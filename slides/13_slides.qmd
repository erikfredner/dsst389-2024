## Change of plans

- We are going to start working on Project 2 today
- We will cover elastic nets on Wednesday
  - If you have not yet watched those videos, please do so

## R updates

R version 4.4.3 was released on 2025-02-28

Download and install the latest version:

<https://cran.r-project.org/>

[Release notes](https://cran.r-project.org/doc/manuals/r-release/NEWS.html)

### Package updates

After a version update, it's good to check for package updates.

Run this line in your R console:

```r
update.packages(ask = FALSE, checkBuilt = TRUE)
```

### RStudio updates

Go to the menu bar, click on `Help`, and then `Check for Updates`.

## Project 1 review

Overall, people did good work!

### Tips for Project 2

- Less is more.
  - Keep the writing to about 400 words.
  - Don't show code, figures, or tables that don't advance your argument.
- Edit aggressively.
  - Good editing shows that you *say what you intend*.
- Don't torture your data.
  - Don't try to make your data say something it can't.
- Use the `styler` package to help with code formatting.
  
### Set up `styler`

`styler` ([link](https://cloud.r-project.org/web/packages/styler/index.html)) is a package that formats code according to [the `tidyverse` style guide](https://style.tidyverse.org/), which we use in this class.

First, install it:

```r
install.packages("styler")
```

### Run `styler` on save

You can set up RStudio to run `styler` to reformat your code every time you save a file.

1. Go to `Tools` and select `Global Options`
2. Click on `Code` in the left-hand pane
3. Select `Formatting` from the tabs and set `styler` as your formatter
4. Then click  on the `Saving` tab and check the option that says `Reformat documents on save`
5. Next time you save a `.qmd` or `.R` file, your code will be reformatted according to the `tidyverse` style guide.

### Optional: Check style compliance with `lintr`

`styler` cannot fix all style issues automatically. But you can combine `styler` with `lintr` to check for style issues that `styler` cannot fix.

First, install `lintr`:

```r
install.packages("lintr")
```

Then, configure it to use the `tidyverse` style:

```r
lintr::use_lintr(type = "tidyverse")
```

### Linting a file

You can run `lintr` on your current file like so:

1. Open the command palette: `Cmd + Shift + P` on macOS or `Ctrl + Shift + P` on Windows
2. Type `lint` and select `lintr: Lint current file`

### Example output

Depending on the style violations you have, you will see a message like this under the Markers tab in the same pane as your Console:
