## Decision Trees

- Decision trees split data into regions based on features
  - The goal is for each split to yield the most information
  - The first split is the "root" of the tree
    - Which is why a tree with a single split is a "stump"
- Splitting on multiple features creates more complex decisions

### Example: [Growing a Tree](http://www.r2d3.us/visual-intro-to-machine-learning-part-1/)

## Balancing bias and variance

::: {.r-fit-text}
- When training the models, we have to balance **bias** and **variance**
- **Bias** errs from overly simplistic assumptions
  - Errors are consistent and persistent
  - e.g., "People who are older than 85 are women."
- **Variance** produces error from overfitting to training data
  - Errors are inconsistent
  - e.g., "People who are older than 85 AND...AND...AND...AND...AND...AND...AND...AND...are women."
- When tuning a model, we want to minimize *both*

### Example: [A Tangible Example of Variance](http://www.r2d3.us/visual-intro-to-machine-learning-part-2/)

## Ensemble methods

- What knowledge should a good trivia team have?
  - Science, History, Art, Literature, Sports, Pop Culture, etc.
  - Often, different team members are responsible for each of these areas
- Like a good trivia team, by combining *multiple* decision trees, we can make a model that is better than the sum of its parts
  
### Ensemble diagram

![A diagram of an ensemble process](images/ensemble.png)

### How to make ensembles

- The allocation function copies and splits the training data up among the trees (`M1`, `M2`, etc.)
- Each tree trains on its subset of the training data
- The combination function weights the predictions of each tree
- The final prediction is the sum of the weighted predictions

## Ensemble method of choice: Gradient Boosted Trees (GBT)

- GBTs are also known as Gradient Boosting Machines (GBMs)
- [XGBoost](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/XGBoost) is a popular implementation that wins many machine learning competitions

### Aside: Why "gradient?"

- This method uses the slope of the error to guide improvements
- For a given prediction, the gradient is the derivative of the loss function
- By following the gradient (i.e., the direction of the steepest error reduction), the model gradually improves its predictions

### Description of gradient boosting algorithm

::: {.r-fit-text}
1. Select a random subset of the training data.
2. Build a decision tree on this subset to predict values.
3. Compute residuals (prediction errors) from this tree and scale them by a small **learning rate**. This prevents any one tree from dominating.
4. Select another random subset of the training data.
5. Build a new decision tree to predict these scaled residuals.
6. Repeat this process, adding trees that successively correct previous errors.
7. Produce final predictions by combining (ensemble) all the trees’ contributions.

## Implementing GBTs

We're going to use:^[This is an updated version of [this](https://www.r-bloggers.com/2020/05/using-xgboost-with-tidymodels/) tutorial.]

- `tidymodels`
- [`parsnip::boost_tree()`](https://parsnip.tidymodels.org/reference/boost_tree.html), which makes it easy to use `xgboost`

### Data

We going to predict housing prices in Ames, Iowa.

```{r}
#| echo: false

library(tidymodels)
library(tidyverse)
library(AmesHousing)
library(janitor)
library(future)
library(xgboost)
library(pdp)

all_cores <- parallel::detectCores(logical = FALSE)
plan(multisession, workers = all_cores)

set.seed(123)
theme_set(theme_minimal())

ames <- make_ames() |>
  janitor::clean_names()
```

```{r}
ames |> glimpse()
```

### Exploratory data analysis

#### Price

```{r}
#| echo: false

ames |>
  ggplot(aes(x = sale_price)) +
  geom_density(fill = "red", alpha = 0.5) +
  scale_x_continuous(labels = scales::dollar_format()) +
  labs(title = "Density plot of house sale prices")
```

#### Square footage

```{r}
#| echo: false

ames |>
  ggplot(aes(x = gr_liv_area)) +
  geom_density(fill = "blue", alpha = 0.5) +
  labs(title = "Density plot of house square footage")
```

#### Year built

```{r}
#| echo: false

ames |>
  ggplot(aes(x = year_built)) +
  geom_density(fill = "yellow", alpha = 0.5) +
  labs(title = "Density plot of the year in which the house was built")
```

#### Garage size (cars)

```{r}
#| echo: false

ames |>
  ggplot(aes(x = garage_cars)) +
  geom_bar(fill = "orange", alpha = 0.5) +
  scale_x_continuous(breaks = ames |> distinct(garage_cars) |> pull()) +
  labs(title = "Bar chart of the number of cars in each house's garage")
```

### Splitting

Note that we are stratifying on `sale_price`:

```{r}
ames_split <- initial_split(ames, prop = 0.8, strata = sale_price)
ames_train <- training(ames_split)
ames_test <- testing(ames_split)
```

### Preprocessing recipe

Unlike kNN, GBT does *not* require normalizing data.

```{r}
ames_recipe <- recipe(sale_price ~ ., data = ames_train) |>
  step_string2factor(all_nominal_predictors()) |>
  step_other(all_nominal_predictors(), threshold = 0.01) |>
  step_dummy(all_nominal_predictors()) |>
  step_nzv(all_predictors())
```

#### `step_` functions

- `step_string2factor()`: Converts character columns to factors.  
- `step_other()`: Groups infrequent factor levels into an "Other" category based on a frequency threshold (e.g., 1%).  
- `step_dummy()`: Converts factor variables into one-hot encoded (binary) dummy variables.  
- `step_nzv()`: Removes near-zero variance predictors (i.e., columns with very little variation that provide minimal predictive value).  

### Set up cross validation

We are using three-fold here **solely** to reduce processing time. Five to ten folds are recommended.

```{r}
ames_folds <- vfold_cv(ames_train, v = 3)
```

### Specify the model

Although we use this for *regression*, XGBoost can also be used for classification by changing the `mode` and the `objective`.

```{r}
xgb_model <- boost_tree(
  mode = "regression",
  trees = 500,
  min_n = tune(),
  tree_depth = tune(),
  learn_rate = tune(),
  loss_reduction = tune()
) |>
  set_engine("xgboost", objective = "reg:squarederror")
```

### Hyperparameter tuning

```{r}
xgb_params <- parameters(
  min_n(),
  tree_depth(),
  learn_rate(),
  loss_reduction()
)
xgb_grid <- grid_space_filling(xgb_params, size = 20)
```

### Hyperparameter grid

```{r}
xgb_grid
```


#### What are these parameters?

  - `min_n`: Minimum number of data points required in a node before it can split.
  - `tree_depth`: Maximum depth of each decision tree (controls complexity).
    - Larger values risk overfitting; smaller values might underfit.
  - `learn_rate`: Controls the contribution of each tree; smaller values require more trees but generalize better.
  - `loss_reduction`: Minimum improvement required to make a further split.

#### What are other parameters we could tune?

::: {.r-fit-text}
  - `subsample`: fraction of rows used per boosting round; reduces overfitting (stochastic boosting).
  - `colsample_bytree`: fraction of columns (features) randomly selected per tree; reduces overfitting.
  - `early_stopping_rounds`: stops training when validation error stops improving.
  - Regularization parameters (`lambda` and `alpha`): penalize complex models to reduce overfitting. 
  - `early_stopping_rounds`: automatically stops training when validation performance plateaus.

### Workflow

```{r}
xgb_wf <- workflow() |>
  add_recipe(ames_recipe) |>
  add_model(xgb_model)
```

### Tuning

```{r}
xgb_tune <- tune_grid(
  xgb_wf,
  resamples = ames_folds,
  grid = xgb_grid,
  metrics = metric_set(rmse, rsq, mae),
  control = control_grid(verbose = TRUE)
)

# Check tuning notes for troubleshooting
show_notes(xgb_tune)
```

### Selecting the best hyperparameters for final fit

```{r}
best_params <- select_best(xgb_tune, metric = "rmse")

final_wf <- finalize_workflow(xgb_wf, best_params)

final_fit <- final_wf |> fit(data = ames_train)
```

### Evaluate training data performance

```{r}
train_preds <- predict(final_fit, ames_train) |>
  bind_cols(ames_train)

train_preds |>
  metrics(truth = sale_price, estimate = .pred) |>
  mutate(.estimate = round(.estimate, 2))
```

### Evaluate testing data performance

The ideal is that the model performs identically on the training and testing data. In reality, it will perform slightly worse on the testing data.

If the model performs much better on training data than testing data, that almost certainly means that it **overfit**.

```{r}
test_preds <- predict(final_fit, ames_test) |>
  bind_cols(ames_test)

test_preds |>
  metrics(truth = sale_price, estimate = .pred) |>
  mutate(.estimate = round(.estimate, 2))
```

### Evaluate performance visually

Plotting residuals can reveal bias. Ideally, the errors will be randomly distributed around zero.

```{r}
#| output-location: slide

test_residuals <- test_preds |>
  mutate(residual_pct = (sale_price - .pred) / .pred)

ggplot(test_residuals, aes(x = residual_pct)) +
  geom_histogram(bins = 30, alpha = 0.5) +
  geom_vline(xintercept = 0, linetype = "dashed", color = "red") +
  labs(x = "Error percentage") +
  scale_x_continuous(labels = scales::percent)
```

## Interpretation

In addition to measuring its performance on metrics like `rmse`, `rsq`, and `mae`, we can interpret the model to understand *how* it makes predictions.

### Identifying important features

`Gain` measures how much a feature improves model accuracy when used for splitting.

```{r}
final_model <- final_fit |> extract_fit_engine()

importance_df <- xgb.importance(model = final_model) |>
  as_tibble() |>
  arrange(desc(Gain)) |>
  slice_head(n = 10)

importance_df
```

### Partial dependence plot

Partial dependence plots show how the model's predictions change as a feature varies, while holding all other features constant.

```{r}
#| echo: false

# Extract the prepped predictors from the fitted workflow
prepped_data <- final_fit |>
  extract_recipe() |>
  bake(new_data = ames_train) |>
  select(-sale_price) # remove target variable

# Compute the partial dependence for the feature "gr_liv_area"
pdp_gr_liv_area <- partial(
  object = final_model,
  pred.var = "gr_liv_area",
  train = prepped_data,
  grid.resolution = 20
)

# Plot the partial dependence
autoplot(pdp_gr_liv_area) +
  scale_y_continuous(labels = scales::dollar_format()) +
  labs(
    title = "Partial Dependence Plot for gr_liv_area",
    x = "Living Area (square feet)",
    y = "Predicted Sale Price"
  )
```

## Summary: Trees

Gradient Boosted Trees (GBTs) sequentially fit decision trees on the residuals of prior models.

- **Decision Trees** form the building blocks by splitting data into regions that maximize information gain.
- **Bias and Variance:** Balancing these is essential for model performance, with decision trees prone to high variance if over-complex.
- **Ensemble Methods:** Combining multiple trees—each contributing a small part—helps to mitigate overfitting and improve predictions.

## Summary: Gradient boosted trees

::: {.r-fit-text}
- **Gradient Boosting:** By iteratively adding trees that correct previous errors, gradient boosting leverages the strengths of each tree.
- **Practical Implementation:** Using `tidymodels` and `xgboost`, we demonstrated how to build, tune, and evaluate a gradient boosted model on the Ames housing dataset.
- Gradient boosted trees are great for regression and classification tasks, especially when combined with systematic hyperparameter tuning and proper data preprocessing.
  - These models generalize well while effectively managing the bias–variance tradeoff.
