## Project 1

- Notebooks: Imitate outputs using direct instructions
- Projects: More like "real-world" data science, where you collect, analyze, and interpret data for others.

### Working on Project 1

### "So what?"

- "So what?" is both the harshest and the most useful question you can ask of any analysis, in data science or anywhere.
- You can also think of the question as, "Who cares?" Or, "why should I care?"
- Your job as an analyst and writer is to do the analysis well, *and* to convince your reader that it makes a difference.
