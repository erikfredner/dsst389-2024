Stereogum called her vocals an ""unabashedly loud and sexual fuck-you New York honk"" and ""a full-bodied New Yawk nasal bleat, the sort of thing that you've heard if someone has ever told you that you stupid for taking too long at swiping your MetroCard."" Pitchfork wrote that her vocal performance in ""WAP"" is in ""her classic throaty style"", while Los Angeles Times characterized it as a ""staccato bark""."

She possesses a New York-Dominican accent."
Cardi B,rapper,"Cardi B has defended her musical content featuring sexually-charged lyrics—like most contemporary female rappers; she stated that the content ""seems like that's what people want to hear"", since she faced negative reactions after releasing her more emotional song, ""Be Careful"".

Also in 2018, she praised President Franklin D. Roosevelt for advocating for the Social Security program and the New Deal project. She said of Roosevelt, ""he helped us get over the Depression, all while he was in a wheelchair. Like, this man was suffering from polio at the time of his presidency, and yet all he was worried about was trying to make America great—make America great again for real. He's the real 'Make America Great Again,' because if it wasn't for him, old people wouldn't even get Social Security.""

During an interview in early 2017, Cardi B spoke on being rejected by some fashion designers. Cardi wore vintage Thierry Mugler to the 2019 Grammy Awards, with an i-D article stating that the fashion house's ""resurgence onto the fashion scene can almost single-handedly be attributed"" to the Swarovski crystal-embroidered crinoline sheath gown she wore at the ceremony."

Drake,rapper,== Early life ==
Drake,rapper,"Aubrey Drake Graham was born on October 24, 1986, in Toronto, Ontario. His father, Dennis Graham, is an African-American drummer from Memphis, Tennessee, who once performed with musician Jerry Lee Lewis. His mother, Sandra ""Sandi"" Graham (née Sher), is a Canadian Ashkenazi Jew, who worked as an English teacher and florist. Graham performed at Club Bluenote in Toronto, where he met Sandra, who was in attendance. Drake is a dual citizen of the United States and Canada, the former derived from Graham. In his youth, he attended a Jewish day school and became a bar mitzvah."
Drake,rapper,"Drake's parents divorced when he was five years old. After the divorce, he and his mother remained in Toronto; his father returned to Memphis, where he was incarcerated for a number of years on drug-related charges. Graham's limited finances and legal issues caused him to remain in the U.S. until Drake's early adulthood. Prior to his arrest, Graham would travel to Toronto and bring Drake to Memphis every summer. Graham claimed in an interview that Drake's assertions of him being an absent father were embellishments used to sell music, which Drake vehemently denies."
Drake,rapper,"Drake was raised in two neighbourhoods. He lived on Weston Road in Toronto's working-class west end until grade six and attended Weston Memorial Junior Public School until grade four, playing minor hockey with the Weston Red Wings. Drake was a promising right winger, reaching the Upper Canada College hockey camp, but left at the behest of his mother following a vicious cross-check to his neck during a game by an opposing player. He moved to one of the city's affluent neighbourhoods, Forest Hill, in 2000. When asked about the move, Drake replied, ""[We had] a half of a house we could live in. The other people had the top half, we had the bottom half. I lived in the basement, my mom lived on the first floor. It was not big, it was not luxurious. It was what we could afford."" At age 10, Drake appeared in a comedic sketch which aired during the 1997 NHL Awards, featuring a riff of Martin Brodeur and Ron Hextall and their record as being the only goalies to have scored multiple goals."
Drake,rapper,"He attended Forest Hill Collegiate Institute for high school, and attended Vaughan Road Academy in Toronto's multicultural Oakwood–Vaughan neighbourhood; Drake described Vaughan Road Academy as ""not by any means the easiest school to go to."" During his teenage years, Drake worked at a now-closed Toronto furniture factory owned by his maternal grandfather, Reuben Sher. Drake said he was bullied at school for his racial and religious background, and upon determining that his class schedule was detrimental to his burgeoning acting career, he dropped out of school. Drake received his high school diploma in October 2012 at age 25."
Drake,rapper,== Career ==
Drake,rapper,=== 2001–2009: Career beginnings ===
Drake,rapper,"At 15, Drake was introduced to a high school friend's father, an acting agent. He found Drake a role on the Canadian teen drama series Degrassi: The Next Generation, in which Drake portrayed Jimmy Brooks, a basketball star who became physically disabled after he was shot by a classmate. When asked about his early acting career, Drake replied, ""My mother was very sick. We were very poor, like broke. The only money I had coming in was [from] Canadian TV."" According to showrunners Linda Schuyler and Stephen Stohn, Drake regularly arrived late on set after spending nights recording music. To prevent this, Schuyler claimed Drake struck an agreement with the set's security guards to gain entry to the set after recording to be allowed to sleep in a dressing room. Drake's first recorded song, ""Do What You Do"", appeared on The N Soundtrack, which was released by The N (the night-time block for Noggin), as it was the network that the series was airing on in the United States."
Drake,rapper,"Being musically inspired by Jay-Z and Clipse, Drake self-released his debut mixtape, Room for Improvement featuring Trey Songz and Lupe Fiasco, in 2006. Drake described the project as ""pretty straightforward, radio friendly, [and] not much content to it."" Room for Improvement was released for sale only and sold roughly 6,000 copies, for which Drake received $304.04 in royalties. He performed his first concert on August 19, 2006, at the Kool Haus nightclub as an opening act for Ice Cube, performing for half an hour and earning $100. In 2007, Drake released his second mixtape Comeback Season. Released from his recently founded October's Very Own label, it spawned the single ""Replacement Girl"" featuring Trey Songz. The song sampled ""Man of the Year"" by Brisco, Flo Rida and Lil Wayne, retaining Lil Wayne's verse; the rapper invited Drake to Houston to join his Tha Carter III tour. On tour, Drake and Lil Wayne recorded multiple songs together, including ""Ransom"", ""Forever"", and a remix to ""Brand New""."
Drake,rapper,"In 2009, Drake released his third mixtape So Far Gone. It was made available for free download through his OVO blog website, and featured Lil Wayne, Trey Songz, Omarion, Lloyd, and Bun B. It received over 2,000 downloads in the first 2 hours of release, finding mainstream commercial success from the singles ""Best I Ever Had"" and ""Successful"", both gaining Platinum certification by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA), with the former also peaking at number two on the Billboard Hot 100. This prompted the mixtape's re-release as an EP, featuring four songs from the original, as well as the additions of the songs ""I'm Goin' In"" and ""Fear"". It debuted at number six on the Billboard 200, and won the Rap Recording of the Year at the 2010 Juno Awards."
Drake,rapper,"Due to the success of the mixtape, Drake was the subject of a bidding war from various labels, often reported as ""one of the biggest bidding wars ever"". He had secured a recording contract with Young Money Entertainment on June 29, 2009. Drake joined the rest of the label's roster on the America's Most Wanted Tour in July 2009. However, during a performance of ""Best I Ever Had"" in Camden, New Jersey, Drake fell on stage and tore the anterior cruciate ligament in his right knee."

The music video for the single was shot in Kingston, Jamaica, and was criticized by Jamaica's minister of tourism Edmund Bartlett.

Drake,rapper,"Thank Me Later was released on June 15, 2010, debuting at number one on the Billboard 200 with sales of over 447,000 copies in its first week. Upon the album's release, 25,000 fans gathered at New York City's South Street Seaport for a free concert hosted by Drake and Hanson, which was later cancelled by the police after a near-riot ensued due to overflowing crowds. The album became the top selling debut album for any artist in 2010 and had the highest sales week for any debut album in the 2010s and featured Lil Wayne, Kanye West, and Jay Z. Drake began his Away from Home Tour on September 20, 2010, in Miami, Florida, performing at 78 shows over four different legs. It concluded in Las Vegas in November 2010.

Drake,rapper,"Drake announced his intentions to allow Noah ""40"" Shebib to record a more cohesive sound on his next album than on Thank Me Later. In November 2010, Drake revealed the title of his next studio album would be Take Care. He sought to expand on the low-tempo, sensuous, and dark sonic esthetic of Thank Me Later. Primarily a hip-hop album, Drake also attempted to incorporate R&B and pop to create a languid, grandiose sound."
Drake,rapper,"In January 2011, Drake was in negotiations to join Eva Green and Susan Sarandon as a member of the cast in Nicholas Jarecki's Arbitrage, before ultimately deciding against starring in the movie to focus on the album. ""Dreams Money Can Buy"" and ""Marvins Room"" were released on Drake's October's Very Own Blog, on May 20 and June 9, respectively. Acting as promotional singles for Take Care, the former was eventually unincluded on the album's final track listing, while ""Marvins Room"" gained 3× Multi-Platinum certification by the RIAA, as well as peaking at number 21 on the Billboard Hot 100. ""Headlines"" was released on August 9 as the album's lead single.

Each song achieved commercial success, and ""The Motto"" was later credited for popularizing the phrase ""YOLO"" in the United States. The music video for ""Take Care"" met with widespread acclaim, receiving four nominations at the 2012 MTV Video Music Awards, including for Video of the Year. ""HYFR"" was the final single to be released from the album, and became certified 2× Multi-Platinum."

Drake,rapper,=== 2013–2015: Nothing Was the Same and If You're Reading This It's Too Late ===
Drake,rapper,"By the Club Paradise Tour's European leg, Drake had begun working on his third studio album, which he said would retain 40 as the album's executive producer, include the influence of British producer Jamie xx, and stylistically differ from Take Care, departing from the ambient production and despondent lyrics previously prevalent. After he won the Grammy Award for Best Rap Album at the 55th Annual Grammy Awards on 10 February 2013, Drake announced his third album, Nothing Was the Same, and released its first single. The album's second single, ""Hold On, We're Going Home"", was released in August, peaking at number one on the Billboard Hot R&B/Hip-Hop Songs chart.

Drake,rapper,"On January 3, 2025, producer Conductor Williams posted the Drake freestyle ""Fighting Irish"" on YouTube, but it was quickly removed. The track was interpreted to contain diss references towards LeBron James, with the title possibly being a reference to James' high school mascot. On February 3, Drake announced Some Sexy Songs 4 U, a collaborative album with PartyNextDoor, which was released on February 14."
Drake,rapper,== Artistry ==
Drake,rapper,=== Influences ===
Drake,rapper,"Drake has cited several hip-hop artists as influencing his rapping style, including Kanye West, Jay-Z, MF Doom, and Lil Wayne, while also attributing various R&B artists as influential to the incorporation of the genre into his own music, including Aaliyah and Usher. Drake has also credited several dancehall artists for later influencing his Caribbean-inflected style, including Vybz Kartel, whom he has called one of his ""biggest inspirations""."
Drake,rapper,=== Musical style ===
Drake,rapper,"Drake is considered to be a pop rap artist. While Drake's earlier music primarily spanned hip-hop and R&B, his music has delved into pop and trap since the albums Nothing Was the Same (2013) and Views (2016). Additionally, his music has drawn influence from regional scenes, including Jamaican dancehall and UK drill. Drake is known for his egotistical lyrics, technical ability, and integration of personal backstory when dealing with relationships with women. His vocal abilities have been lauded for an audible contrast between typical hip-hop beats and melody, with sometimes abrasive rapping coupled with softer accents, delivered on technical lyricism."
Drake,rapper,"His songs often include audible changes in lyrical pronunciation in parallel with his upbringing in Toronto, and connections with Caribbean and Middle Eastern countries which include such phrases as ""ting"", ""touching road"", ""talkin' boasy"" and ""gwanin' wassy"". Most of his songs contain R&B and Canadian hip-hop elements, and he combines rapping with singing. He credits his father with the introduction of singing into his rap mixtapes, which have become a staple in his musical repertoire. His incorporation of melody into technically complex lyrics was supported by Lil Wayne, and has subsequently been a critical component to Drake's singles and albums. Drake's style of R&B is characterized by vacant beats and a rap-sung dichotomy, which has also seen incredible mainstream success, spawning several imitators."
Drake,rapper,"The lyrical content that Drake deploys is typically considered to be emotional or boastful. However, Drake is often revered for incorporating ""degrading"" themes of money, drug use, and women into newer, idealized contexts, often achieving this through his augmentation of the typical meaning of phrases in which he combines an objective and subjective perspective into one vocal delivery. His songs often maintain tension between ""pause and pace, tone timbre, and volume and vocal fermata."" Drake is credited with innovating what has been referred to as ""hyper-reality rap"", characterized by its focus on themes of celebrity as distinct from the ""real world."""
Drake,rapper,== Public image ==
Drake,rapper,"Drake's lyrical subject matter, which often revolves around relationships, have had widespread use on social media through photo captions to reference emotions or personal situations. However, this content has incited mixed reception from fans and critics, with some deeming him as sensitive and inauthentic, traits perceived as antithetical to traditional hip-hop culture. He is also known for his large and extravagant lifestyle, including for high-end themed birthday parties; he maintained this image in his early career by renting a Rolls-Royce Phantom, which he was eventually gifted in 2021. He cultivated a reputation as a successful gambler; between December 2021 and February 2022, he was reported to have made bets of over $1 billion, which included winnings ranging between $354,000 and $7 million, however some of the forms of gambling he promotes, such as roulette, have negative expected values."
Drake,rapper,"The Washington Post editor Maura Judkis credits Drake for popularizing the phrase ""YOLO"" in the United States with his single ""The Motto"", which stands for, ""You only live once."" Drake later popularized the term ""The Six"" in 2015 in relation to his hometown Toronto, subsequently becoming a point of reference to the city. June 10 was declared ""Drake Day"" in Houston. In 2016, Drake visited Drake University after a show in Des Moines in response to an extensive social media campaign by students that began in 2009, advocating for his appearance. According to a report from Confused.com, Drake's Toronto home was one of the most Googled homes in the world, recording over a million annual searches in 2021; its features, such as its NBA-size indoor basketball court and Kohler Numi toilet, have also received widespread media attention."
Drake,rapper,"The music video for ""Hotline Bling"" went viral due to Drake's eccentric dance moves. The video has been remixed, memed, and was heavily commented on due to the unconventional nature on the song, causing it to gain popularity on YouTube, and spawning several parodies. Drake has also been critiqued for his expensive, product placement-heavy attire, exemplified by the video for ""Hotline Bling"". Drake modelled a $1,500 Moncler Puffer Jacket, a $400 Acne Studios turtleneck, and limited edition Timberland 6"" Classic Boots. He was labeled by GQ magazine as ""[one of] the most stylish men alive""; during promotion for Certified Lover Boy, Drake debuted a ""heart haircut"", which became popular and widely imitated. Writing for GQ, Anish Patel noted Drake's consistent incorporation of styles and themes not typically associated with hip-hop, such as wearing gorpcore in the music video for his song ""Sticky"". Since 2016 Drake has been noted for an alleged ""Drake curse"", an internet meme based on the incidents where he appears to be support of particular sports team or person, just for that team or person to lose, often against the odds."
Drake,rapper,"In 2016, Drake discussed the shooting of Alton Sterling, publishing an open letter expressing his concern for the safety of ethnic minorities against police brutality in the United States. In 2021, he joined a group of Canadian musicians to work with the Songwriters Association of Canada (SAC) to lobby Prime Minister Justin Trudeau to restructure the country's copyright law to allow artists and their families to regain ownership of copyrights during their lifetime. He also campaigned for the expansion of a Women's National Basketball Association (WNBA) franchise in Toronto, and headlined a benefit concert at the Los Angeles Memorial Coliseum with Kanye West on December 9, 2021, to raise clemency for Larry Hoover, although his solo performance was later removed from the Prime Video replay. On Christmas 2021, Drake gave away money to individuals in Toronto. In October 2023, he signed a letter calling for a ceasefire in the Israel–Hamas war."
Drake,rapper,== Impact ==
Drake,rapper,"A prominent figure in pop culture, Drake is often praised one of the most influential figures in hip-hop; particularly his use of singing over hip-hop instrumentals has been noted as an influence on modern rappers. He is widely credited for popularizing the Toronto sound to the music industry and leading the ""Canadian Invasion"", a play on the British Invasion in the 1960s, of the American charts—alongside the likes of Justin Bieber and the Weeknd. In 2022, music recognition app Shazam revealed Drake to be their most searched artist by users, with music featuring Drake collecting 350 million recognitions; his 2016 single ""One Dance"" collected 17 million recognitions alone. In 2018, articles by The Guardian and Rolling Stone called him ""the definitive pop star of his generation"" and ""perhaps [the] biggest post-Justin Timberlake male pop star of the new millennium"", respectively."
Drake,rapper,"The Insider declared Drake the artist of the decade (2010s). Regarding the general view that Drake introduced singing in mainstream hip-hop, the publication said that at the height of Auto-Tune in hip-hop during the late 2000s, ""there were virtually no artists who were both a legit rapper and a legit crooner who delivered velvety smooth pop/R&B hybrid vocals that could exist separately from his hip-hop songs."" Commenting on Drake's Take Care, Elias Leight of Rolling Stone noticed in 2020 that ""now nearly every singer raps, and nearly every rapper sings"", as many artists ""have borrowed or copied the template of [the album] that the boldness of the original is easily forgotten"", according to the writer."
Drake,rapper,"Aaron Williams of Uproxx added ""jump-starting the sad boy rapper craze alongside Kid Cudi"" and ""helping to renew stateside interest in UK grime and Caribbean dancehall with Skepta, PartyNextDoor, and Rihanna"" to the modern trends Drake assisted. BBC Radio 1Xtra argued that his co-signs helped push the British hip-hop scene to a wider international market, as he did with the Toronto music scene. According to CBS Music in 2019, Drake has inspired ""the next wave"" of artists coming out of his hometown. Writing for Bloomberg, Lucas Shaw commented Drake's popularity has influenced the promotion of music, with Certified Lover Boy attaining large commercial success despite relatively minimal orthodox marketing techniques, stating ""fans are consuming Drake's [music] in a way that is different to others"". He also noted the album as novel in relation to consumption, with each song having relatively equivalent streams, as opposed to a dominant single(s). Justin Charity of The Ringer noted Drake's signature of producing ""half-hearted"" performances on songs to create a ""natural and off-the-cuff"" effect has become the ""obvious touchpoint for [subsequent] male R&B singers"". Charity further wrote Drake's success in the genre is ""so thorough that it's all but impossible to hear certain vintages of R&B without hearing Drake""."
Drake,rapper,"Beginning in 2022, Drake's music was canonized academically by Toronto Metropolitan University, which began teaching courses titled ""Deconstructing Drake and the Weeknd"", with the pair's music used to explore themes related to the Canadian music industry, race, class, marketing and globalization. With the release during LGBT Pride Month of his seventh album Honestly, Nevermind (2022), Mark Savage of the BBC wrote Drake's exploration of house, a genre with overt origins in black and queer spaces, would help ""build a bridge to those [origin] subcultures"" for younger music listeners."
Drake,rapper,== Achievements ==
Drake,rapper,"Drake is the highest-certified digital singles artist ever in the United States, having moved 142 million units based on combined sales and on-demand streams. His highest-certified single is ""God's Plan"" (15× Platinum), followed by ""Hotline Bling"" and ""One Dance"", which are certified Diamond. Drake was Spotify's most streamed artist of the 2010s."

In 2021, Drake became second act to occupy the entire Hot 100's top five in a single week, the other act being the Beatles in 1964. He also has the most number-one singles on the Hot Rap Songs (23), Hot R&B/Hip-Hop Songs (23), and Hot R&B/Hip-Hop Airplay. He is also the only artist to have two albums log 400 weeks each on the Billboard 200."
Drake,rapper,"As of 2021, Drake has won four Grammy Awards from 47 nominations. He has also won a record 29 Billboard Music Awards. In 2017, he surpassed Adele's record for most wins at the Billboard Music Awards in one night, winning 13 awards from 22 nominations. He was named Artist of the Decade at the 2021 Billboard Music Awards. Billboard editor Ernest Baker stated ""Drake managed to rule hip-hop in 2014"", adding ""the best rapper in 2014 didn't need a new album or hit single to prove his dominance"". From 2015 to 2017, Drake ranked within the top-five of the Billboard Year-End chart for Top Artists, before topping it in 2018. He was named the IFPI Global Recording Artist of 2016 and 2018."
Drake,rapper,"Pitchfork ranked Nothing Was the Same as the 41st best album of the decade ""so far""—between 2010 and 2014, and ranked him fifth in the publication's list of the ""Top 10 Music Artists"" since 2010. Take Care was ranked at number 95 on Rolling Stone's 500 Greatest Albums of All Time (2020). He has been ranked by Complex on their ""Best Rapper Alive Every Year Since 1979"" list, awarding Drake the accolade in 2011, 2012, and 2015."
Drake,rapper,== Controversies ==
Drake,rapper,=== Legal issues ===
Drake,rapper,"In 2012, singer Ericka Lee filed a lawsuit against Drake for the usage of her voice on ""Marvins Room"". Claiming to have provided the female vocals, Lee also alleged she was owed songwriting credits and royalties. Despite Drake's legal team countering by claiming that Lee simply requested a credit in the liner notes of the album, the matter was resolved in February 2013, with both parties agreeing to an out-of-court settlement. Also in 2012, Drake caused a nightclub in Oklahoma City to close down, due to his usage of marijuana and other illegal drugs being prevalent at the club. In 2014, Drake was sued for $300,000 for sampling ""Jimmy Smith Rap"", a 1982 single by jazz musician Jimmy Smith. The suit was filed by Smith's estate, who said Drake never asked for permission when sampling it for the intro on ""Pound Cake / Paris Morton Music 2"", claiming Smith himself would have disagreed as he disliked hip-hop. Drake would win the lawsuit in 2017, with federal judge William Pauley ruling the content used was transformative, and there was no liability for copyright infringement. Also in 2014, it emerged that Drake was sued by rapper Rappin' 4-Tay, claiming Drake misused his lyrics when collaborating with YG on the song ""Who Do You Love?"". He sought $100,000 for mistreatment and artistic theft, which Drake paid to the rapper later that year."
Drake,rapper,"In December 2021, Drake sued jeweler Ori Vechler and his company Gemma LTD for incorrectly using his likeness in promotional material; he also sought to return three items he purchased. In December 2022, a lawsuit brought by rapper Angelou Skywalker, who alleged that Drake stole his song ""Reach for Skies"" to make ""Way 2 Sexy"", was dismissed following ""repeated misconduct"" by Skywalker against prosecutors and U.S. district judge Colleen Kollar-Kotelly, who presided over the case; Skywalker was accused of filing no less than 50 irrelevant motions and was handed a restraining order, preventing contact with Drake."
Drake,rapper,"In 2017, Drake was embroiled in another lawsuit, being sued by producer Detail (Noel Fisher) over an alleged assault in 2014. Fisher claimed Drake's bodyguard, Nessel ""Chubbs"" Beezer, punched him in the face and allegedly broke his jaw over musical and financial disputes. Fisher also said the injuries caused him to be hospitalized for days and had to undergo several surgeries, following which he sued for damages related to medical bills and physical and emotional suffering. The case, which was set to undergo trial in May 2018, was dismissed by Superior Court Judge Elaine Lu after Fisher failed to show up for a final status conference. Lu ruled that Beezer solely acted in self-defense."
Drake,rapper,"In January 2019, Drake, Odell Beckham Jr., and Younes Bendjima were sued by a man named Bennett Sipes in regards to an alleged assault that occurred outside of a L.A. nightclub in 2018. Sipes claims he suffered ""traumatic brain injury, as well as injuries to his back, neck, shoulders, etc."" on March 24, 2018, when he was attacked by Bendjima, as well as members of Drake and Beckham's entourages in an alley near the nightclub and sought $250,000 in damages. The suit alleges Drake and Beckham followed their respective crews to the alley to watch Sipes get attacked. A video of the incident was recorded using the on-site surveillance system. The suit was eventually settled out of court. In 2019, Drake paid a $350,000 settlement to a woman who alleged that he sexually assaulted her. Drake denied the allegations."
Drake,rapper,"In October 2021, Drake and Chris Brown were sued by Braindon Cooper and Timothy Valentine for copyright infringement between ""No Guidance"" and their own song ""I Love Your Dress"", but Drake was dropped by Cooper and Valentine from the lawsuit in April 2022. Drake was handed another copyright lawsuit from Samuel Nicholas, citing infringement from Drake's ""In My Feelings"" and ""Nice for What"". That November, he was named co-defendant with Travis Scott in a multi-claimant lawsuit for inciting ""a riot and violence"" at the Astroworld Festival, to which he released a statement; he reportedly delayed the release of ""Splash Brothers"", a collaboration with French Montana, as a result."
Drake,rapper,"On July 14, 2022, Drake was detained by Swedish police, reportedly stemming from drugs present within a Stockholm nightclub. That November, Drake and 21 Savage were sued by Condé Nast, the publisher of Vogue, for using the Vogue name without permission to promote their collaborative album Her Loss; Drake and 21 Savage ""voluntarily ceased"" to a preliminary injunction to stop using Vogue trademarks to promote the album, and later reached a settlement with Condé Nast. In February 2023, Drake was ordered to appear for a deposition in the XXXTentacion murder trial after the defense team for Dedrick Williams—one of the three suspects—listed Drake as a potential witness, related to the purported feud between Drake and XXXTentacion; Drake was subpoenaed the month prior, and failed to show for his scheduled deposition date of January 27; the rescheduled deposition was set for February 24. It was later reported that armed guards at Drake's Beverly Hills home refused to accept the service of the deposition on February 14, which Drake's lawyer, Bradford Cohen, argued was not properly served in compliance with California law and done solely to ""inject celebrity spectacle in a routine trial"", ultimately leading to the deposition being dismissed."
Drake,rapper,"In November 2024, Drake initiated a legal petition against Universal Music Group (UMG), the parent company of Republic Records, with whom Drake has a recording contract, and Spotify, alleging they conspired to artificially inflate the number of streams of the diss track ""Not Like Us"" during Drake's feud with Kendrick Lamar earlier that year by implementing pay-to-play, malicious bots, and other tactics. Drake withdrew the petition on January 14, 2025, and filed a lawsuit a day later, alleging defamation against UMG for promoting ""Not Like Us""."
Drake,rapper,=== Feuds ===
Drake,rapper,"Drake and Chris Brown were allegedly involved in a physical altercation in June 2012 when Drake and his entourage threw glass bottles at Brown in a SoHo nightclub in Manhattan, New York City. Chris Brown tweeted about the incident, and criticized Drake in music until 2013, including on the ""R.I.P."" remix. Despite no response from Drake, he and Brown both appeared in a comedic skit for the 2014 ESPY Awards, and rehearsed the skit together prior to the televised airing, virtually ending the dispute. The pair later collaborated on ""No Guidance"" in 2019."
Drake,rapper,"The Drake-Kendrick Lamar feud was identified by media outlets from 2013, alleging several songs to be sneak disses by both parties. Lamar first dissed Drake and other rappers on the song ""Control"" in 2013, but stated his verse was intended to be seen as ""friendly competition"": Drake and Lamar previously collaborated on songs and Lamar featured as Drake's opening act on the Club Paradise Tour in 2012. Lamar dissed Drake and J. Cole in 2024, with Drake and J. Cole's 2023 song ""First Person Shooter"" alleged to be a sneak diss. Drake responded on the songs ""Push Ups"" and ""Taylor Made Freestyle"", of which, Lamar responded with ""Euphoria"" and ""6:16 in LA"". Drake then released ""Family Matters"", accusing Lamar of domestic abuse and alleging one of Lamar's children was fathered by Dave Free. Lamar first replied with ""Meet the Grahams"", accusing Drake of sex crimes and fathering a secret child, and then with ""Not Like Us"", accusing Drake of pedophilia and anti-black sentiment. Drake responded with ""The Heart Part 6"", denying Lamar's accusations and claiming he gave Lamar false information about the secret child."
Drake,rapper,"In December 2014, Drake was involved in another altercation, being punched by Puff Daddy outside the LIV nightclub in Miami. The altercation was reported to be over Drake's usage of the instrumental for ""0 to 100 / The Catch Up"", allegedly produced by Boi-1da for Puff Daddy, before Drake appropriated it for himself. Drake was rushed to the ER after aggravating an old arm injury during the dispute. Drake was also involved in a feud with Tyga, stemming from Tyga's negative comments about him during an interview with Vibe magazine. Drake would later respond on ""6 God"" and ""6PM in New York"", which has been interpreted as directly involved in Tyga's abrupt removal from Young Money Entertainment."
Drake,rapper,"Controversy arose in July 2015 when Meek Mill alleged that Drake had used ghostwriters for his verse on ""R.I.C.O."". This was followed by further allegations that Drake did not help promote the song because Meek Mill discovered the ghostwriter, whom he revealed to be Quentin Miller. Despite Miller receiving past writing credits, Funkmaster Flex aired reference tracks by Miller, who was revealed to have helped write ""R.I.C.O."", ""10 Bands"", and ""Know Yourself"". This prompted Drake to respond with two diss tracks: ""Charged Up"" and ""Back to Back"", in the space of four days. Meek Mill responded with ""Wanna Know"", before removing it from SoundCloud weeks later. Following several subliminal disses from either artist, Drake further sought to denounce Funkmaster Flex while performing in New York (Flex's home state) on the Summer Sixteen Tour. After Meek Mill's 2017 prison sentence for probation violation, Drake stated ""Free Meek Mill"" at a concert in Australia, and ended their rivalry on ""Family Feud"" in 2018; the pair later collaborated on ""Going Bad"" in 2019."
Drake,rapper,"Pusha T would use the same rationale to diss Drake on ""Infrared"" in 2018, leading Drake to respond with the ""Duppy Freestyle"" diss track on May 25. Pusha T responded with ""The Story of Adidon"" on May 29, which presented several claims and revealed Drake's fatherhood. The pair are considered to have been in a rivalry since 2012, resulting from Pusha T's feuds with Lil Wayne and Birdman, with Drake yet to respond to ""The Story of Adidon""."
Drake,rapper,"In 2016, Drake was embroiled in a feud with Joe Budden, stemming from Budden's derogatory comments when reviewing Views. Drake would allegedly respond to Budden through ""4PM in Calabasas"", prompting Budden to respond with two diss tracks in the space of five days, echoing the same sentiment Drake deployed during his feud with Meek Mill. Drake would later appear on ""No Shopping"" alongside French Montana, directly referencing Budden throughout the song, although, Montana claimed Drake's verse was recorded before the release of Budden's diss tracks. Despite Budden releasing two further songs in reference to Drake, he has yet to officially respond to Budden. In the same year, Drake dissed Kid Cudi on ""Two Birds, One Stone"" after Cudi launched an expletive-filled rant on the artist on Twitter. Cudi later checked into a rehabilitation facility following the release of the song, and continued to disparage Drake in further tweets; the pair eventually resolved their feud, and collaborated on ""IMY2"" in 2021."
Drake,rapper,"In mid-2018, Drake was embroiled in a feud with long-time collaborator Kanye West. In an appearance on The Shop, Drake recounted several meetings with West, who voiced his desire to ""be Quincy Jones"" and work with Drake and replicate the producer-artist relationship between Jones and Michael Jackson. West requested Drake play and inform him of upcoming releases, while he gave Drake the instrumental to ""Lift Yourself"". West requested the pair work in Wyoming, with Drake arriving a day after close friend 40, who said West was instead recording an album. Judging the pair to have differing release schedules, Drake traveled to Wyoming, but ""only worked on [West's] music""; they explored Drake's after he played West ""March 14"", which addressed Drake's relationship with his newborn son and co-parent. This prompted a conversation with West regarding his personal issues, after which, news of his son would be exposed by Pusha T, which Drake concluded was revealed to him by West; West also released ""Lift Yourself"" as a solo song and produced ""Infrared"". Drake then denounced West in songs and live performances. West would retaliate in a series of tweets in late 2018, and the pair continued to respond on social media and in music as of late 2021, which included Drake leaking West's song ""Life of the Party"". During their feud, West and Drake have had public attempts of reconciliation, which is reported to have occurred after they co-headlined a benefit concert in December 2021."
Drake,rapper,"Drake has been involved in reported feuds with DMX, music critic Anthony Fantano, Common, the Weeknd, XXXTentacion, Jay-Z, Tory Lanez, and Ludacris, although the latter three, as well as his feud with DMX, have been reported to be resolved."

This would be his second foray into selling foodstuffs, previously partnering with celebrity chef Susur Lee to open Fring's Restaurant and Antonio Park to open the sports bar Pick 6ix, both in Toronto and eventually closed. Virginia Black was created and distributed by Proximo Spirits and Brent Hocking, a spirits producer who founded DeLeón Tequila in 2008. The company described the partnership as ""fruitful [as they] share a passion for style, music, and the pursuit of taste [on] a quest to redefine whiskey."" In 2021, using ratings compiled from Vivino and complimentary website Distiller, Virginia Black was ranked the worst value celebrity liquor for quality and price."
Drake,rapper,"The product was launched in June 2016, and contained two, three and four-year old Bourbon whiskies. The company sold over 4,000 bottles in the first week domestically. The brand was also promoted and marketed through Drake's music and various tours, such as being part of the ""Virginia Black VIP Lounge"" additional package available for purchase during the Summer Sixteen Tour. Virginia Black shipped a further 30,000 units when rollout was extended to select international markets in late 2016. The company later aired commercials with Drake's father, Dennis Graham, which featured the mock tagline of ""The Realest Dude Ever"" (in reference toward ""The Most Interesting Man in the World"" tagline employed by Dos Equis) after extending the sale of the drink to Europe in 2017. In 2019, Drake began collaborating with Hocking on Mod Sélection, a luxury range of champagne, and in May 2021, formed part of a $40 million series B investment funding round led by D1 Capital Partners in Daring Foods Inc., a vegan meat analogue corporation. That September, he purchased a minority stake in Californian food chain Dave's Hot Chicken, and organized a promotion on October 24, 2022, to give away free chicken to Toronto residents on his 36th birthday."
Drake,rapper,=== Fashion ===
Drake,rapper,"In December 2013, Drake announced he was signing with Nike and Air Jordan, saying ""growing up, I'm sure we all idolized Michael Jordan. I [am] officially inducted into the Team Jordan family."" Drake also released his own collection of Air Jordans, dubbed the ""Air Jordan OVOs"". This foresaw collaborations between OVO and Canada Goose, in which various items of clothing were produced. In 2020, A Bathing Ape announced a collaboration with Drake, releasing an OVO x BAPE collection of clothing, while he also partnered with candle manufacturer Revolve to create ""Better World Fragrance"", a line of scented candles."
Drake,rapper,"In December 2020, Drake announced Nocta, a sub-label with Nike. In a press release, Drake said ""I always felt like there was an opportunity for Nike to embrace an entertainer the same way [as] athletes,"" he wrote, ""to be associated with the highest level possible was always my goal."" The apparel line is named after Drake's ""nocturnal creative process"", in which Nike described as a ""collection for the collective"", and noted by GQ as ""fashion-forward, minimal-inspired sportswear"". One clothing item features an image of Drake's muses, Elizabeth and Victoria Lejonhjärta, with a poem. After the first collection sold out, another was released in February 2021, which introduced t-shirts, adjustable caps, a utility vest, and a lightweight jacket. That July, OVO released the ""Weekender Collection"", which includes a line of hoodies, velour sweatsuits, t-shirts, shorts, and accessories for women. OVO then released a ""Winter Survival Collection"" that December which included puffer jackets, vests, and parkas made with 700-fill down and Oeko-Tex certified down feathers. They followed this with limited Jurassic Park-themed collection and an indoor footwear collaboration with Suicoke, as well as a Playboy-collaborated capsule collection."
Drake,rapper,"In July 2022, a capsule inspired by and in collaboration with Mike Tyson was released, featuring both blouson jackets and caps. In conjunction with Spotify's 12-year, $540 million sponsorship deal with FC Barcelona, the club wore special edition OVO owl silhouette branded jerseys in their El Clásico match against Real Madrid CF on October 16, 2022. OVO then partnered with former professional ice hockey player Tie Domi and fashion retailer Roots Canada to release a capsule collection on October 28, matching Domi's jersey number for the New York Rangers and Toronto Maple Leafs; a capsule collection was later released in collaboration with the Maple Leafs in November."

Drake,rapper,=== Health and residences ===
Drake,rapper,"Drake lives in Toronto, Ontario, in a 35,000-square-foot, $100 million estate nicknamed ""The Embassy"", which was built from the ground-up in 2017 and is seen in the video to his song ""Toosie Slide"". He owned a home nicknamed the ""YOLO Estate"" in Hidden Hills, California, from 2012 to 2022, and bought a Beverly Crest home in 2022 from Robbie Williams for $70 million. He owns a condominium adjacent to the CN Tower. He also owns a Boeing 767, and in 2021, rented a $65 million multi-purpose property in Beverly Hills."
Drake,rapper,"Drake has a variety of tattoos, some of which are symbols associated with personal accomplishments, such as a jack-o-lantern, ""October Lejonhjärta"" (transl. October Lionheart), owls, and a controversial Abbey Road (1969) inspired depiction of himself and the Beatles. He has portraits of Lil Wayne, Sade, Aaliyah, Jesús Malverde, Denzel Washington, 40, his parents, grandmother, maternal uncle, and son; and several related to Toronto, including the CN Tower and the number ""416""."
Drake,rapper,"On August 18, 2021, Drake revealed he contracted COVID-19 amidst the pandemic, which led to temporary hair loss. He was also one of the first celebrities to publicly test for the virus in March 2020. He contracted the disease again in 2022, causing the postponement of reunion concerts with Lil Wayne and Nicki Minaj."
Drake,rapper,=== Family and relationships ===
Drake,rapper,"Drake's paternal uncles are musicians Larry Graham and Teenie Hodges. Larry Graham was a member of Sly and the Family Stone, while Hodges contributed to songs for Al Green, including ""Love and Happiness"", ""Here I Am (Come and Take Me)"", and ""Take Me to the River""."
Drake,rapper,"He dated SZA between 2008 and 2009, and in 2011 reports emerged that he was dating Serena Williams."
Drake,rapper,"Drake was in an on-again, off-again relationship with Rihanna from 2009 to 2016. He has mentioned the relationship in every one of his studio albums, and when presenting Rihanna with the Michael Jackson Video Vanguard Award in 2016, he said ""she's a woman I've been in love with since I was 22 years old."" On his relationship with her, he said on the talk show The Shop:"
Drake,rapper,"As life takes shape and teaches you your own lessons, I end up in this situation where I don't have the fairy tale [of] 'Drake started a family with Rihanna, [it's] so perfect.' It looks so good on paper [and] I wanted it too at one time."
Drake,rapper,"Drake is a father to a son named Adonis, who was born on October 11, 2017, to French painter and former model Sophie Brussaux. Brussaux's pregnancy was the subject of several rumours after featuring in a TMZ article in early 2017. After the nature of the pair's relationship was discussed in Pusha T's ""The Story of Adidon"", Drake confirmed his fatherhood on the album Scorpion in 2018."

Eminem,rapper,"Marshall Bruce Mathers III (born October 17, 1972), known professionally as Eminem (often stylized as EMINƎM), is an American rapper, songwriter, and record producer. He is credited with popularizing hip-hop in Middle America and is widely regarded as one of the greatest rappers of all time. His success is considered to have broken racial barriers to the acceptance of white rappers in popular music. While much of his transgressive work during the late 1990s and early 2000s made him a controversial figure, he came to be a representation of popular angst of the American underclass and has influenced many musical artists. His most successful songs on the U.S. Billboard Hot 100 include ""The Real Slim Shady"", ""Without Me"", ""Lose Yourself"", ""Not Afraid"", ""Love the Way You Lie"", ""The Monster"", ""Godzilla"", and ""Houdini""."
Eminem,rapper,"After the release of his debut album Infinite (1996) and the extended play Slim Shady EP (1997), Eminem signed with Dr. Dre's Aftermath Entertainment and subsequently achieved mainstream popularity in 1999 with The Slim Shady LP. His next two releases, The Marshall Mathers LP (2000) and The Eminem Show (2002), were worldwide successes and nominated for the Grammy Award for Album of the Year, the latter becoming the best-selling album worldwide of 2002. After the release of his next album, Encore (2004), Eminem went on hiatus, largely due to a prescription drug addiction. He returned to the music industry with the releases of Relapse (2009) and Recovery (2010), the latter becoming the best-selling album worldwide of 2010. He then released the U.S. number-one albums The Marshall Mathers LP 2 (2013), Revival (2017), Kamikaze (2018), Music to Be Murdered By (2020), and The Death of Slim Shady (Coup de Grâce) (2024)."
Eminem,rapper,"Eminem was also a member of the hip-hop groups New Jacks, Soul Intent, Outsidaz, and D12, and has collaborated with fellow Detroit-based rapper Royce da 5'9"" as the duo Bad Meets Evil. Eminem starred in the 2002 musical drama film 8 Mile playing a dramatized version of himself. ""Lose Yourself"", a song from its soundtrack, topped the Billboard Hot 100 for 12 weeks—the most for a solo rap song—and won the Academy Award for Best Original Song, making him the first hip-hop artist ever to win the award. He also co-founded Shady Records, which helped launch the careers of artists such as D12, 50 Cent, and Obie Trice, and established his own Sirius XM Radio channel, Shade 45."
Eminem,rapper,"Eminem is among the best-selling music artists of all time, with estimated worldwide sales of over 220 million records. He was the best-selling music artist in the United States for the 2000s, placing third for the 2010s. He was the first artist to have ten albums consecutively debut at number one on the Billboard 200 chart, and has had five number-one singles on the Billboard Hot 100. The Marshall Mathers LP, The Eminem Show, Curtain Call: The Hits (2005), ""Lose Yourself"", ""Love the Way You Lie"", and ""Not Afraid"" have all been certified Diamond or higher by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA). He has won numerous awards, including 15 Grammy Awards, eight American Music Awards, 17 Billboard Music Awards, a Primetime Emmy Award, and an MTV Europe Music Global Icon Award. Billboard named him the ""Artist of the Decade (2000–2009)"", and Rolling Stone named him one of the ""100 Greatest Artists of All Time"" and ""100 Greatest Songwriters of All Time"". In 2022, he was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame."
Eminem,rapper,== Early life ==
Eminem,rapper,"Marshall Bruce Mathers III was born on October 17, 1972, in St. Joseph, Missouri, the only child of Marshall Bruce Mathers Jr. and Deborah ""Debbie"" Nelson.: 17  His mother nearly died during her 73-hour labor with him.: 1  Eminem's parents were in a band called Daddy Warbucks, playing in Ramada Inns along the Dakotas–Montana border before they separated. His father abandoned his family when Eminem was a year and a half old, and Eminem was raised only by his mother, Debbie, in poverty. He wrote letters to his father, but Debbie said that they all came back marked ""return to sender""."
Eminem,rapper,"By the age of twelve, Eminem and his mother shuttled between states, rarely staying in one house for more than a year or two and mostly living with family members, moved several times and lived in St. Joseph; Savannah, Missouri; Kansas City; Warren, Michigan; and Roseville, Michigan before settling in Detroit. For much of his youth, Eminem and his mother lived in a bungalow-style house in a working-class, primarily black, neighborhood in Detroit. He and Debbie were one of three white households on their block, and Eminem was beaten several times by black youths. His mother had a son named Nathan ""Nate"" Kane Samara in 1986 with then boyfriend Fred Samara. In 2013, the State of Michigan demolished his childhood home after it was damaged by arson."
Eminem,rapper,"Eminem frequently fought with his mother, whom a social worker described as having a ""very suspicious, almost paranoid personality"".: 3  When he was a child, a bully named D'Angelo Bailey severely injured Eminem's head in an assault, an incident which Eminem later recounted (with comic exaggeration) on the song ""Brain Damage"". Debbie filed a lawsuit against the public school for this in 1982. The suit was dismissed the following year by a Macomb County, Michigan, judge, who said the schools were immune from lawsuits.: 2 "
Eminem,rapper,"Eminem was interested in storytelling, aspiring to be a comic book artist before discovering hip-hop. He heard his first rap song (""Reckless"", featuring Ice-T) on the Breakin' soundtrack, a gift from Debbie's half-brother, Ronnie Polkingharn. His uncle was close to the boy and later became a musical mentor to him. Following Polkingharn's suicide in 1991, Eminem stopped speaking publicly for days and did not attend his funeral."
Eminem,rapper,"At age 14, Eminem began rapping with high-school friend Mike Ruby; they adopted the names ""Manix"" and ""M&M"", the latter evolving into ""Eminem"".: 4  Eminem snuck into neighboring Osborn High School with friend and fellow rapper Proof for lunchroom freestyle rap battles.: 119  On Saturdays, they attended open mic contests at the Hip-Hop Shop on West 7 Mile Road, considered ""ground zero"" for the Detroit rap scene. Struggling to succeed in a predominantly black industry, Eminem was appreciated by underground hip-hop audiences. When he wrote verses, he wanted most of the words to rhyme; he wrote long words or phrases on paper and, underneath, worked on rhymes for each syllable. Although the words often made little sense, the drill helped Eminem practice sounds and rhymes."
Eminem,rapper,"In 1987, Debbie allowed runaway Kimberly Anne ""Kim"" Scott to stay at their home. Several years later, Eminem began an on-and-off relationship with Scott.: 4  After spending three years in ninth grade due to truancy and poor grades, 17-year-old Eminem dropped out of Lincoln High School. Although interested in English, Eminem never explored literature, preferring comic books, and he disliked math and social studies. He states that he later received a GED. Eminem worked at several jobs to help his mother pay the bills, one of which was at Little Caesar's Pizza in Warren. He later said she often threw him out of the house anyway, often after taking most of his paycheck. When she left to play bingo, he would blast the stereo and write songs."
Eminem,rapper,== Music career ==
Eminem,rapper,"=== 1988–1997: Early career, Infinite and family struggles ==="
Eminem,rapper,"In 1988, he went by the stage name MC Double M and formed his first group, New Jacks, and made a self-titled demo tape with DJ Butter Fingers. In 1989, they later joined Bassmint Productions who later changed their name to Soul Intent in 1992 with rapper Proof and other childhood friends. They released a self-titled EP in 1995 featuring Proof. Eminem also made his first music video appearance in 1992 in a song titled, ""Do-Da-Dippity"", by Champtown. Later in 1996, Eminem and Proof teamed up with four other rappers to form The Dirty Dozen (D12), who released The Underground E.P. in 1997 and their first album Devil's Night in 2001. He was also affiliated with Newark's rap collective Outsidaz, collaborating with them on different projects."
Eminem,rapper,"In 1995, Eminem was signed to Jeff and Mark Bass' F.B.T. Productions and in 1995–1996 recorded his debut album Infinite for their independent Web Entertainment label.: 15  The album was a commercial failure upon its release in 1996. One lyrical subject of Infinite was his struggle to raise his newborn daughter, Hailie Jade Scott Mathers, on little money. During this period, Eminem's rhyming style, primarily inspired by rappers Nas, Esham and AZ, lacked the comically violent slant for which he later became known.: 16  Detroit disc jockeys largely ignored Infinite and the feedback Eminem did receive (""Why don't you go into rock and roll?"") led him to craft angrier, moodier tracks."
Eminem,rapper,"At this time, Eminem and Kim Scott lived in a crime-ridden neighborhood where their house was robbed several times. Eminem cooked and washed dishes for minimum wage at Gilbert's Lodge, a family-style restaurant in St. Clair Shores.: 14  His former boss described him as becoming a model employee, as he worked 60 hours a week for six months after Hailie's birth.: 4  He was fired shortly before Christmas and later said, ""It was, like, five days before Christmas, which is Hailie's birthday. I had, like, forty dollars to get her something."" After the release of Infinite, his personal problems and substance abuse culminated in a suicide attempt. By March 1997, he was fired from Gilbert's Lodge for the last time and lived in his mother's mobile home with Kim and Hailie.: 4 "
Eminem,rapper,"=== 1997–1999: Introduction of Slim Shady, The Slim Shady LP and rise to success ==="
Eminem,rapper,"Eminem attracted more attention when he developed Slim Shady, a sadistic, violent alter ego. The character allowed him to express his anger with lyrics about drugs, rape and murder.: 4  In the spring of 1997, he recorded his debut EP, the Slim Shady EP, which was released that winter by Web Entertainment. The EP, with frequent references to drug use, sexual acts, mental instability and violence, also explored the more-serious themes of dealing with poverty and marital and family difficulties and revealed his direct, self-deprecating response to criticism. Hip-hop magazine The Source featured Eminem in its ""Unsigned Hype"" column in March 1998.: 81 "
Eminem,rapper,"After he was fired from his job and evicted from his home, Eminem went to Los Angeles to compete in the 1997 Rap Olympics, a nationwide battle rap competition. He placed second, losing to Project Blowed MC Otherwize. An Interscope Records intern named Dean Geistlinger was in attendance and asked Eminem for a copy of the Slim Shady EP, which was then sent to company CEO Jimmy Iovine. Iovine played the tape for record producer Dr. Dre, founder of Aftermath Entertainment and founding member of hip-hop group N.W.A. Dre recalled, ""In my entire career in the music industry, I have never found anything from a demo tape or a CD. When Jimmy played this, I said, 'Find him. Now.'"" Dre would later state on the fourth and last episode of The Defiant Ones, ""I was like: what the fuck!?, and who the fuck is that?"" expressing his shock towards Mathers's rapping talent. Although his associates criticized him for hiring a white rapper, Dre was confident in his decision: ""I don't give a fuck if you're purple; if you can kick it, I'm working with you."" Eminem had idolized Dre since listening to N.W.A as a teenager and was nervous about working with him on an album: ""I didn't want to be starstruck or kiss his ass too much ... I'm just a little white boy from Detroit. I had never seen stars let alone Dr. Dre."": 24  He became more comfortable working with Dre after a series of productive recording sessions. On March 9, 1998, Eminem got signed to Aftermath and Interscope."
Eminem,rapper,"Eminem released The Slim Shady LP in February 1999. Although it was one of the year's most popular albums (certified triple platinum by the end of the year), he was accused of imitating the style and subject matter of underground rapper Cage (who he references in the album's song ""Role Model""). The album's popularity was accompanied by controversy over its lyrics; in ""'97 Bonnie & Clyde"" Eminem describes a trip with his infant daughter when he disposes of his wife's body and in ""Guilty Conscience"" which encourages a man to murder his wife and her lover. ""Guilty Conscience"" marked the beginning of a friendship and musical bond between Dr. Dre and Eminem. The label-mates later collaborated on a number of hit songs (""Forgot About Dre"" and ""What's the Difference"" while also providing uncredited vocals on ""The Watcher"" from Dr. Dre's album 2001, ""Bitch Please II"" from The Marshall Mathers LP, ""Say What You Say"" from The Eminem Show, ""Encore/Curtains Down"" from Encore and ""Old Time's Sake"" and ""Crack a Bottle"" from Relapse) and Dre made at least one guest appearance on each of Eminem's Aftermath albums. The Slim Shady LP has been certified quadruple platinum by the RIAA."
Eminem,rapper,=== 1999–2003: The Marshall Mathers LP and The Eminem Show ===
Eminem,rapper,"After Eminem released The Slim Shady LP, he started his own record label, Shady Records, in late 1999. Eminem looked for an avenue to release D12, and his manager Paul Rosenberg was keen to start a label, which led to the two teaming up to form Shady. Its A&R Marc Labelle has defined the record label as ""a boutique label but [with] all the outlets of a major [and] Interscope backing up our every move."""
Eminem,rapper,"Recorded from 1999 to 2000, The Marshall Mathers LP was released in May 2000. It sold 1.76 million copies in its first week, breaking U.S. records held by Snoop Dogg's Doggystyle for fastest-selling hip-hop album and Britney Spears' ...Baby One More Time for fastest-selling solo album. The first single from the album, ""The Real Slim Shady"", was a success despite controversies about Eminem's insults and dubious claims about celebrities (for example, that Christina Aguilera had performed oral sex on Carson Daly and Fred Durst).: 60  In his second single, ""The Way I Am"", he reveals the pressure from his record company to top ""My Name Is"". Although Eminem parodied shock rocker Marilyn Manson in the music video for ""My Name Is"", they are reportedly on good terms; Manson is mentioned in ""The Way I Am"", appeared in its music video and has performed a live remix of the song with Eminem. In the third single, ""Stan"" (which samples Dido's ""Thank You""), Eminem tries to deal with his new fame, assuming the persona of a deranged fan who kills himself and his pregnant girlfriend (mirroring ""'97 Bonnie & Clyde"" from The Slim Shady LP)."
Eminem,rapper,"The music magazine Q called ""Stan"" the third-greatest rap song ever, and it was ranked tenth in a Top40-Charts.com survey. The song has since been ranked 296th on Rolling Stone's ""500 Greatest Songs of All Time"" list. In July 2000, Eminem was the first white artist to appear on the cover of The Source.: 81  The Marshall Mathers LP was certified Diamond by the RIAA in March 2011 and sold 21 million copies worldwide."
Eminem,rapper,"In 2000, Eminem also appeared in the Up in Smoke Tour with rappers Dr. Dre, Snoop Dogg, Xzibit, and Ice Cube and the Family Values Tour with Limp Bizkit,: 70  headlining the Anger Management Tour with Papa Roach, Ludacris, and Xzibit. Eminem performed with Elton John at the 43rd Grammy Awards ceremony in 2001, with the Gay & Lesbian Alliance Against Defamation (GLAAD, an organization which considered Eminem's lyrics homophobic) condemning John's decision to perform with Eminem. Entertainment Weekly placed the appearance on its end-of-decade ""best-of"" list: ""It was the hug heard 'round the world. Eminem, under fire for homophobic lyrics, shared the stage with a gay icon for a performance of 'Stan' that would have been memorable in any context."" On February 21, the day of the awards ceremony, GLAAD held a protest outside the Staples Center (the ceremony's venue). Eminem was also the only guest artist to appear on fellow rapper Jay-Z's critically acclaimed album The Blueprint, producing and rapping on the song ""Renegade""."
Eminem,rapper,"The Eminem Show was released in May 2002. It was another success, reaching number one on the charts and selling over 1.332 million copies during its first full week. The album's single, ""Without Me"", denigrates boy bands, Limp Bizkit, Dick and Lynne Cheney, Moby and others. The Eminem Show, certified Diamond by the RIAA, examines the effects of Eminem's rise to fame, his relationship with his wife and daughter and his status in the hip-hop community, addressing an assault charge brought by a bouncer he saw kissing his wife in 2000. Stephen Thomas Erlewine of AllMusic found The Eminem Show less inflammatory than The Marshall Mathers LP. L. Brent Bozell III, who had criticized The Marshall Mathers LP for misogynistic lyrics, noted The Eminem Show's extensive use of obscenity and called Eminem ""Eminef"" for the prevalence of the word ""motherfucker"" on the album. The Eminem Show sold 27 million copies worldwide and was the bestselling album of 2002."
Eminem,rapper,"=== 2003–2007: Production work, Encore and musical hiatus ==="
Eminem,rapper,"In 2003, Eminem, a lifelong fan of Tupac, provided production work for three tracks on the Tupac Resurrection soundtrack. He would follow this up the next year by producing 12 of the 16 tracks on Tupac's Loyal to the Game album. On December 8, 2003, the United States Secret Service said that it was ""looking into"" allegations that Eminem had threatened the President of the United States. The cause for concern was the lyrics of ""We As Americans"" (""Fuck money / I don't rap for dead presidents / I'd rather see the president dead / It's never been said, but I set precedents""), which was later released on a bonus CD with the deluxe edition of Encore."
Eminem,rapper,"Encore, released in 2004, was another success, but not as successful as his previous albums. Its sales were partially driven by the first single, ""Just Lose It"", which contained slurs directed toward Michael Jackson. On October 12, 2004, a week after the release of ""Just Lose It"", Jackson phoned Steve Harvey's radio show, The Steve Harvey Morning Show, to report his displeasure with its video (which parodies Jackson's child molestation trial, plastic surgery and the 1984 incident when Jackson's hair caught fire during the filming of a commercial). In the song, Eminem says, ""That's not a stab at Michael / That's just a metaphor / I'm just psycho."" Many of Jackson's friends and supporters spoke out against the video, including Stevie Wonder, who described it as ""kicking a man while he's down"" and ""bullshit"", and Steve Harvey (who said, ""Eminem has lost his ghetto pass. We want the pass back""). The video also parodied Pee-wee Herman, MC Hammer and Madonna during her Blond Ambition period. ""Weird Al"" Yankovic, who parodied the Eminem song ""Lose Yourself"" on ""Couch Potato"" for his 2003 album Poodle Hat, told the Chicago Sun-Times about Jackson's protest: ""Last year, Eminem forced me to halt production on the video for my 'Lose Yourself' parody because he somehow thought that it would be harmful to his image or career. So the irony of this situation with Michael is not lost on me."" Although Black Entertainment Television stopped playing the video, MTV announced that it would continue to air it. The Source, through CEO Raymond ""Benzino"" Scott, called for the video to be pulled, the song removed from the album and Eminem to apologize publicly to Jackson. In 2007, Jackson and Sony bought Famous Music from Viacom, giving him the rights to songs by Eminem, Shakira, Beck and others."
Eminem,rapper,"Despite its lead single's humorous theme, Encore explored serious subject matter with the anti-war song ""Mosh"", which criticized President George W. Bush as ""This weapon of mass destruction that we call our president"", with lyrics including ""Fuck Bush."" On October 25, 2004, a week before the 2004 U.S. Presidential election, Eminem released the video for ""Mosh"" on the Internet. In it, Eminem gathers an army (including rapper Lloyd Banks) of Bush-administration victims and leads them to the White House. When they break in, it is learned that they are there to register to vote; the video ends with ""VOTE Tuesday November 2."" After Bush's reelection, the video's ending was changed to Eminem and the protesters invading the White House during a speech by the president. Also in 2004 Eminem launched a satellite music channel, Shade 45, on Sirius radio, which was described by his manager as ""essentially a destination to get and hear things that other people aren't playing."""
Eminem,rapper,"Eminem began his first U.S. concert tour in three years in the summer of 2005 with the Anger Management 3 Tour, featuring 50 Cent, G-Unit, Lil Jon, D12, Obie Trice and the Alchemist, but in August, Eminem canceled the European leg of the tour, later announcing that he had entered drug rehabilitation for treatment of a ""dependency on sleep medication"". Meanwhile, industry insiders speculated that Eminem was considering retirement, while rumors circulated that a double album titled The Funeral would be released. In July, the Detroit Free Press reported a possible final bow for Eminem as a solo performer, quoting members of his inner circle as saying that he would embrace the roles of producer and label executive. A greatest hits album, Curtain Call: The Hits, was released on December 6, 2005, by Aftermath Entertainment, and sold nearly 441,000 copies in the U.S. in its first week, marking Eminem's fourth consecutive number-one album on the Billboard Hot 200, and was certified double platinum by the RIAA. However, Eminem suggested that month on WKQI's ""Mojo in the Morning"" show that he would be taking a break as an artist: ""I'm at a point in my life right now where I feel like I don't know where my career is going ... This is the reason that we called it 'Curtain Call' because this could be the final thing. We don't know."""
Eminem,rapper,"In April 2006, Proof, who was Eminem's childhood friend, was murdered. Eight months later, on December 5, Eminem released a compilation album titled Eminem Presents: The Re-Up that featured Proof and other Shady Records artists."
Eminem,rapper,=== 2007–2009: Comeback and Relapse ===
Eminem,rapper,"In September 2007, Eminem called New York radio station WQHT during an interview with 50 Cent, saying that he was ""in limbo"" and ""debating"" about when (or if) he would release another album: ""I'm always working—I'm always in the studio. It feels good right now, the energy of the label. For a while, I didn't want to go back to the studio ... I went through some personal things. I'm coming out of those personal things [and] it feels good."""
Eminem,rapper,"Eminem appeared on his Shade 45 Sirius channel in September 2008, saying: ""Right now I'm kinda just concentrating on my own stuff, for right now and just banging out tracks and producing a lot of stuff. You know, the more I keep producing the better it seems like I get 'cause I just start knowing stuff."" Interscope confirmed that a new album would be released in spring 2009. In December 2008, Eminem provided more details about the album, entitled Relapse: ""Me and Dre are back in the lab like the old days, man. Dre will end up producing the majority of the tracks on 'Relapse'. We are up to our old mischievous ways ... let's just leave it at that."""
Eminem,rapper,"According to a March 5, 2009, press release, Eminem would release two new albums that year. Relapse, the first, was released on May 19; its first single and music video, ""We Made You"", had been released on April 7. Although Relapse did not sell as well as Eminem's previous albums and received mixed reviews, it was a commercial success and re-established his presence in the hip-hop world. It sold more than five million copies worldwide. On October 30, he headlined at the Voodoo Experience in New Orleans, his first full performance of the year. Eminem's act included several songs from Relapse, many of his older hits and an appearance by D12. On November 19, he announced on his website that Relapse: Refill would be released on December 21. The album was a re-release of Relapse with seven bonus tracks, including ""Forever"" and ""Taking My Ball"". Eminem described the CD:"
Eminem,rapper,"I want to deliver more material for the fans this year like I originally planned ... Hopefully, these tracks on The Refill will tide the fans over until we put out Relapse 2 next year ... I got back in with Dre and then a few more producers, including Just Blaze, and went in a completely different direction which made me start from scratch. The new tracks started to sound very different than the tracks I originally intended to be on Relapse 2, but I still want the other stuff to be heard."
Eminem,rapper,=== 2009–2011: Recovery and Bad Meets Evil reunion ===
Eminem,rapper,"On April 14, 2010, Eminem tweeted: ""There is no Relapse 2"". Although his followers thought he was not releasing an album, he had changed its title to Recovery and confirmed this by tweeting ""Recovery"" with a link to his website. He said:"
Eminem,rapper,"I had originally planned for Relapse 2 to come out last year. But as I kept recording and working with new producers, the idea of a sequel to Relapse started to make less and less sense to me, and I wanted to make a completely new album. The music on Recovery came out very different from Relapse, and I think it deserves its own title."
Eminem,rapper,"Recorded from 2009 to 2010, Recovery was released on June 18. In the U.S., Recovery sold 741,000 copies during its first week, topping the Billboard 200 chart. Eminem's sixth consecutive U.S. number-one album also topped the charts in several other countries. Recovery remained atop the Billboard 200 chart for five consecutive weeks of a seven-week total."
Eminem,rapper,"Billboard reported that it was the bestselling album of 2010, making Eminem the first artist in Nielsen SoundScan history with two year-end bestselling albums. Recovery is the bestselling digital album in history. Its first single, ""Not Afraid"", was released on April 29 and debuted atop the Billboard Hot 100; its music video was released on June 4. ""Not Afraid"" was followed by ""Love the Way You Lie"", which debuted at number two before rising to the top. Although ""Love the Way You Lie"" was the bestselling 2010 single in the United Kingdom, it did not reach number one (the first time this has happened in the UK since 1969). Despite criticism of its inconsistency, Recovery received positive reviews from most critics. As of November 21, 2010, the album had U.S. sales of three million copies. Recovery was the bestselling album worldwide in 2010, joining 2002's bestseller The Eminem Show to give Eminem two worldwide year-end number-one albums. With Recovery, Eminem broke the record for the most successive U.S. number-one albums by a solo artist."
Eminem,rapper,"He appeared at the 2010 BET Awards, performing ""Not Afraid"" and ""Airplanes, Part II"" with B.o.B and Keyshia Cole. Later that year, he performed at the Activison E3 concert.

He opened the 2010 MTV Video Music Awards on September 12, performing ""Not Afraid"" and ""Love the Way You Lie"" with Rihanna singing the choruses. Due to the success of Recovery and the Home & Home Tour, Eminem was named the 2010 Hottest MC in the Game by MTV and Emcee of the Year by the online magazine HipHopDX. He and Rihanna again collaborated on ""Love the Way You Lie (Part II)"", the sequel of their hit single. Unlike the original, Rihanna is the lead vocalist and it is sung from the female perspective.

Eminem participated in the 2017 BET Hip Hop Awards' annual cypher, using his verse, a freestyle rap called ""The Storm"", to further criticize Trump and the administration for, among other things, Trump's focus on National Football League players' protests during ""The Star Spangled Banner"" over Hurricane Maria recovery efforts and lack of gun control reform in the wake of the 2017 Las Vegas shooting.

Eminem,rapper,== Artistry ==
Eminem,rapper,"=== Influences, style and rapping technique ==="
Eminem,rapper,"Eminem has cited several MCs as influencing his rapping style, including Esham, Kool G Rap,: 88  Masta Ace, Big Daddy Kane,: 88  Tupac Shakur, Newcleus, Ice-T, Mantronix, Melle Mel (on ""The Message""), LL Cool J, Beastie Boys, Run-D.M.C., Rakim, and Boogie Down Productions. At the 2022 Rock and Roll Hall of Fame induction, Eminem named more than 100 artists from hip-hop's golden age — from rap's early days through to the mid-1990s — who contributed, in ways big and small, to the artist he would become."
Eminem,rapper,"In How to Rap, Guerilla Black notes that Eminem studied other MCs to hone his rapping technique: ""Eminem listened to everything and that's what made him one of the greats"".: x  In the book, other MCs also praise aspects of his rapping technique: varied, humorous subject matter,: 5, 38  connecting with his audience,: 7  carrying a concept over a series of albums,: 34  complex rhyme schemes,: 66, 107  bending words so they rhyme,: 85  multisyllabic rhymes,: 88  many rhymes to a bar,: 106  complex rhythms,: 120, 129  clear enunciation,: 244  and the use of melody: 253  and syncopation.: 257  Eminem is known to write most of his lyrics on paper (documented in The Way I Am), taking several days or a week to craft lyrics,: 160  being a ""workaholic"": 212  and ""stacking"" vocals.: 282  Examples of hip-hop subgenres that Eminem's music has been described as include horrorcore,: 52 : 80  comedy hip-hop, and hardcore hip-hop. Eminem also incorporates rap rock into his music and has cited rock acts during the 1970s and 1980s, such as Jimi Hendrix and Led Zeppelin, as influences in his music."
Eminem,rapper,=== Alter egos ===
Eminem,rapper,"Eminem uses alter egos in his songs for different rapping styles and subject matter, including Slim Shady and Ken Kaniff, among others."
Eminem,rapper,"Slim Shady is the controversial and rebellious alter ego of Eminem, introduced in his 1997 extended play The Slim Shady EP. Conceived during a period of personal and professional struggle, Slim Shady allowed Eminem to express his darker, more aggressive thoughts through exaggerated and often violent lyrical content. This persona embodies the chaotic, satirical side of Eminem's music, pushing boundaries with provocative, sometimes offensive, themes, which blend fiction and reality. The use of Slim Shady is shown in The Slim Shady LP, The Marshall Mathers LP, The Eminem Show, Encore, Relapse, The Marshall Mathers LP 2, Kamikaze, Music to Be Murdered By, and The Death of Slim Shady (Coup de Grâce)."
Eminem,rapper,"Slim Shady's influence on Eminem's career is significant. His shock-value content helped skyrocket the rapper to fame, but also attracted criticism and legal challenges, particularly due to songs like ""'97 Bonnie and Clyde"" and ""Kim"", where he addresses deeply personal and often disturbing subjects, such as family conflicts and imagined violence. Despite the controversy, the Slim Shady character is credited with much of Eminem's early success, but over time, the persona also contributed to the rapper's personal struggles, including substance abuse."
Eminem,rapper,"Another character is Ken Kaniff, a gay man who pokes fun at Eminem's songs. Ken was created and originally played by fellow Detroit rapper Aristotle on The Slim Shady LP, where Kaniff makes a prank call to Eminem. An argument after the album's release prompted Eminem to use the Kaniff character on The Marshall Mathers LP and later albums (except Encore and Recovery). Aristotle, angry with Eminem's use of his character, released a mixtape in his Kaniff persona ridiculing him."
Eminem,rapper,=== Collaborations and productions ===
Eminem,rapper,"Although Eminem usually collaborates with Aftermath Entertainment and Shady Records rappers such as Dr. Dre, 50 Cent, D12, Obie Trice and Yelawolf, he has also worked with Redman, Kid Rock, DMX, Lil Wayne, Missy Elliott, Jay Z, Drake, Rihanna, Nas, Kanye West, Nicki Minaj, Xzibit, Method Man, Jadakiss, Fat Joe, Sticky Fingaz, T.I. and Young Jeezy.

Eminem produced several tracks on Trick-Trick's The Villain (appearing on ""Who Want It"") and produced four tracks on Cashis' 2013 album The County Hound 2."
Eminem,rapper,"Eminem has only produced for and appeared on one track with former Aftermath/Interscope labelmate The Game; ""We Ain't"" (a track from Game's January 2005 debut album, The Documentary). In 2022, Game would later release a ten-minute diss track towards Eminem titled ""The Black Slim Shady""."
Eminem,rapper,"Eminem is considered unusual in structuring his songs around the lyrics, rather than writing to beats. One exception was ""Stan"", which came from an idea and scratch track produced by the 45 King. After doing little production on Relapse and Recovery, Eminem produced a significant portion of The Marshall Mathers LP 2. He said about producing his own music, ""Sometimes, I may get something in my head, like an idea or the mood of something that I would want, and I'm not always gonna get that by going through different tracks that other people have made. They don't know what's in my head. I think maybe it helps, a little bit, with diversity, the sound of it, but also, I would get something in my head and want to be able to lay down that idea from scratch."" In 1998 when his beef with rapper Cage was still happening, New York rapper Necro (who had previously produced three songs for Cage) met Eminem and gave him a CD with the beat to what eventually became the beat for the song ""Black Helicopters"" by rap group Non-Phixion. Despite Eminem never using it, Necro still said positive things about Eminem and would appear on Shade45 years later."
Eminem,rapper,=== Comparisons with other artists ===
Eminem,rapper,"As a white performer prominent in a genre influenced by black artists, Eminem has been compared, much to his chagrin, to Elvis Presley, and has lyrically been compared to Bob Dylan. Rapper Asher Roth has been compared to Eminem and Roth devoted a song on his album (""As I Em"") to him, which Eminem took offense to. The accomplished trumpeter Nicholas Payton has called Eminem ""the Bix Beiderbecke of hip-hop""."
Eminem,rapper,== Legacy ==
Eminem,rapper,"Credited for popularizing hip-hop to a Middle American audience, Eminem's unprecedented global commercial success and acclaimed works for a white rapper is widely recognized for breaking racial barriers for the acceptance of white rappers in popular music. Rising from rags to riches, Eminem's anger-fueled music represented widespread angst and the reality of American underclass."
Eminem,rapper,"Stephen Hill, the then vice president of African American-themed television network BET (Black Entertainment Television), said in 2002:Eminem gets a pass in the same vein that back during segregation black folks had to be better than average, had to be the best, to be accepted ... he is better than the best. In his own way, he is the best lyricist, alliterator and enunciator out there in hip-hop music. In terms of rapping about the pain that other disenfranchised people feel, there is no one better at their game than Eminem."
Eminem,rapper,"In 2002, the BBC said that the perception of Eminem as a ""modern-day William Shakespeare"" was comparable to the reception of American singer Bob Dylan: ""Not since Bob Dylan's heyday in the mid-1960s has an artist's output been subjected to such intense academic scrutiny as an exercise in contemporary soul-searching. U.S. critics point to [Eminem's] vivid portraits of disenfranchised lives—using the stark, direct language of the street—as an accurate reflection of social injustice."" In addition, the BBC highlighted that, ""Where parents once recoiled in horror [to his music], there now seems a greater willingness to acknowledge a music that is striking such a chord among the American young, angry white underclass."" Dan Ozzi of Vice highlighted that Eminem during the early 2000s was ""the one artist high school kids seemed to unanimously connect with ... he represented everything high school years are about: blind rage, misguided rebellion, adolescent frustration. He was like a human middle finger. An X-rated Dennis the Menace for a dial-up modem generation."""
Eminem,rapper,"Writing for Spin in 2002, rock critic Alan Light compared Eminem to the Beatles' John Lennon:"
Eminem,rapper,"Eminem is even starting to bear a resemblance to one of those rock icons ... Marshall Mathers is becoming something like this generation's John Lennon ... Lennon and Eminem were both subjects of pickets and protests; they both wrote songs about troubled relationships with their mothers; they both wrote about their strange public lives with their wives; they both wrote about how much they loved their kids. Lennon, of course, was able to find ways to use his voice to advocate for peace rather than just blasting away at litigious family members and various pop stars, but still, few other pop musicians since Lennon have found a way to render their private psychodramas into compelling art as effectively as Eminem."
Eminem,rapper,"Regarding his rehearsal with Eminem for the ""Stan"" duet at the 2001 Grammy Awards, English singer Elton John said, ""⁠[When] Eminem made his entrance, I got goose bumps, the likes of which I have not felt since I first saw Jimi Hendrix, Mick Jagger, James Brown and Aretha Franklin. Eminem was that good. I just thought, 'Fuck, this man is amazing'. There are very few performers who can grab you like that the first time—only the greats."" John further praised Eminem, saying, ""Eminem is a true poet of his time, someone we'll be talking about for decades to come. He tells stories in such a powerful and distinctive way. As a lyricist, he's one of the best ever. Eminem does for his audience what [Bob] Dylan did for his: He writes how he feels. His anger, vulnerability and humor come out."""
Eminem,rapper,"Concerning the controversy surrounding Eminem due to his transgressive music, Madonna said in 2003 ""I like the fact that Eminem is brash and angry and politically incorrect ... He's stirring things up, he's provoking a discussion, he's making people's blood boil. He's reflecting what's going on in society right now. That is what art is supposed to do."" American musician Stevie Wonder added ""Rap to me is a modern blues—a statement of how and where people are at ... I think art is a reflection of our society, and people don't like to confront the realities in society ... But until we really confront the truth, we are going to have a Tupac or Eminem or Biggie Smalls to remind us about it—and thank God. They force people to look at realities in society."""
Eminem,rapper,"The previously mentioned Bob Dylan praised Eminem, along with other artists, in a 2022 interview with The Wall Street Journal."
Eminem,rapper,"Eminem has been credited with boosting the careers of hip-hop proteges such as 50 Cent, Yelawolf, Stat Quo, Royce da 5'9"", Cashis, Obie Trice, Bobby Creekwater, Boogie and hip-hop groups such as D12 and Slaughterhouse.

In 2005 Eminem signed another Atlanta rapper, Bobby Creekwater and West Coast rapper Cashis to Shady Records."
Eminem,rapper,"On December 5, 2006, the compilation album Eminem Presents: The Re-Up was released on Shady Records. The project began as a mixtape, but when Eminem found the material better than expected he released it as an album. The Re-Up was intended to introduce Stat Quo, Cashis and Bobby Creekwater. While he was recording Infinite, Eminem, Proof and Kon Artis assembled a group of fellow rappers now known as D12, short for ""Detroit Twelve"" or ""Dirty Dozen"", who performed in a style similar to Wu-Tang Clan.: 19  In 2001 D12's debut album, Devil's Night, was released. The first single from the album was ""Shit on You"", followed by ""Purple Pills"" (an ode to recreational drug use) and ""Fight Music"". ""Purple Pills"" was rewritten for radio and television, removing many of the song's references to drugs and sex and renamed ""Purple Hills""."
Eminem,rapper,"After their debut, D12 took a three-year break from the studio. They reunited in 2004 for their second album, D12 World, which included the hit singles ""My Band"" and ""How Come"". ""American Psycho 2"" featuring Cypress Hill member, B-Real, was another popular hit. According to D12 member Bizarre, Eminem was not featured on his album Blue Cheese & Coney Island because ""he's busy doing his thing""."
Eminem,rapper,"In January 2014, Bass Brothers announced that D12 had returned to record at F.B.T. Studio and they were working on an album with Eminem on at least three songs. Bizarre reported that he was still part of the group and that the album was scheduled for a 2014 release."

Eminem,rapper,=== Mom's Spaghetti restaurant ===
Eminem,rapper,"On September 29, 2021, Eminem and Union Joints opened a spaghetti restaurant at 2131 Woodward Ave in Detroit. It is a reference to the lyrics ""His palms are sweaty, knees weak, arms are heavy / There's vomit on his sweater already, mom's spaghetti"" from the song ""Lose Yourself"" which became an internet meme. Mom's Spaghetti was previously a pop-up in Detroit in 2017 and at Coachella in 2018. In 2023, Eminem announced the launch of a ""Mom's Spaghetti"" jarred pasta sauce. In 2024, Mom's Spaghetti appeared in Fortnite as part of season Chapter 2 Remix."
Eminem,rapper,=== Acting career ===
Eminem,rapper,"After small roles in the 2001 film The Wash and as an extra in the 1998 Korn music video for ""Got the Life"" (during which he gave the band a demo tape), Eminem made his Hollywood debut in the semi-autobiographical 2002 film 8 Mile. He said it was a representation of growing up in Detroit rather than an account of his life. He recorded several new songs for the soundtrack, including ""Lose Yourself"" (which won an Academy Award for Best Original Song in 2003 and became the longest-running No. 1 hip-hop single in history).

Eminem,rapper,"He played himself in the Entourage season-seven finale ""Lose Yourself"" with Christina Aguilera. Although Eminem was offered the lead role in the 2013 science-fiction film Elysium, he turned it down because director Neill Blomkamp would not change its location from Los Angeles to Detroit.

Eminem,rapper,"In December 2024, Eminem's mother Debbie Nelson died due to complications from lung cancer."
Eminem,rapper,=== Health problems ===
Eminem,rapper,"Eminem has spoken publicly about his addiction to prescription drugs, including Vicodin, Ambien, and Valium. According to friend and fellow D12 member Proof, Eminem, who previously hinted in his 1999 single ""My Name Is"" that he avoided the use of drugs after experiencing his mother's history of drug abuse, first developed a drug addiction in 2002. During the production of 8 Mile, Eminem, working 16 hours a day, developed insomnia. An associate gave him an Ambien tablet which ""knocked [him] out"", encouraging him to obtain a prescription. This was Eminem's first experience of drug addiction, which would affect him for several years. Near the end of production on Encore, he would ""just go into the studio and goof off [with] a pocketful of pills"". Eminem began taking the drugs to ""feel normal"", taking a ""ridiculous amount ... I could consume anywhere from 40 to 60 Valium [in a day]. Vicodin, maybe 30."" The drugs would put him to sleep for no more than two hours, after which he would take more. Eminem's weight increased to 230 pounds (100 kg) and he was regularly eating fast food: ""The kids behind the counter knew me—it wouldn't even faze them. Or I'd sit up at Denny's or Big Boy and just eat by myself. It was sad."" Eminem became less recognizable due to his weight gain and once overheard two teenagers arguing about whether or not it was him: ""Eminem ain't fat."""
Eminem,rapper,"In December 2007, Eminem was hospitalized after a methadone overdose. He had first bought from a dealer who had told him it was ""just like Vicodin, and easier on [your] liver"". He continued to buy more until he collapsed in his bathroom one night and was rushed to the hospital. Doctors there told him he had ingested the equivalent of four bags of heroin and was ""about two hours from dying"". After missing Christmas with his children, Hailie, Alaina and Stevie, Eminem checked himself out of the facility, weak and not fully detoxed. He tore the meniscus in his knee after falling asleep on his sofa, requiring surgery; after he returned home, he had a seizure. His drug use ""ramped right back to where it was before"" within a month. Eminem began to attend church meetings to get clean, but after he was asked for autographs he sought help from a rehabilitation counselor. He began an exercise program that emphasized running. Elton John was a mentor during this period, calling Eminem once a week to check on him. Eminem has been sober since April 20, 2008."
Eminem,rapper,=== Threats ===
Eminem,rapper,"In April 2020, Matthew David Hughes, a 26-year-old man, broke into Eminem's house in Clinton Township, Macomb County, Michigan, breaking a kitchen window with a brick paver. Eminem woke up with Hughes standing behind him and Hughes said that he was there to kill Eminem. Hughes was charged with multiple offences; his defense attorney opined that he seemed to be suffering from ""mental issues"". In a plea agreement in 2021, Hughes pleaded guilty to second-degree home invasion in exchange for dismissal of other charges; he was sentenced to probation and time served (524 days in the county jail). In 2019, Hughes had pleaded guilty to breaking into a Rochester Hills home in search of Eminem. On August 30, 2023, it was revealed that the perpetrator of the 2023 Jacksonville shooting Ryan Palmeter targeted Eminem and Machine Gun Kelly as his victims in a racially-motivated attack."
Eminem,rapper,=== Politics ===
Eminem,rapper,"During the late 1990s and early 2000s, Eminem attacked politicians of both the Democratic and Republican parties, including then President and First Lady Bill and Hillary Clinton, and Second Ladies Tipper Gore and Lynne Cheney, the latter two being activists against violent lyrics in music. In the song ""Mosh"", which was a few weeks before the 2004 United States presidential election, Eminem heavily criticized then-president George W. Bush but did not endorse John Kerry either. While openly endorsing Barack Obama in a 2009 interview, Eminem would not express political views in music again until the 2016 United States presidential election when he released ""Campaign Speech"", which criticized presidential candidate Donald Trump. The following year, Eminem criticized Trump in a freestyle titled ""The Storm"". In the freestyle, Eminem expressed support for former San Francisco 49ers quarterback Colin Kaepernick and the U.S. national anthem protests, and expressed his displeasure for any of his fans that support Trump. His 2020 song ""Darkness"" heavily references the 2017 Las Vegas mass shooting, and at the end of the music video he expresses support for gun control."
Eminem,rapper,"The week before the 2020 presidential election, Eminem approved his song ""Lose Yourself"" to be used in a campaign video for Joe Biden. After the United States Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade, Eminem posted a tweet to his Twitter expressing his displeasure for the decision saying ""As a father it pisses me off that women have fewer rights 2day than just a few days ago… we r fuckin goin bckwards. Here's how 2 help in Michigan. [sic]"" and included a link to a pro-choice organization in Michigan. In 2023, he requested that Republican election candidate Vivek Ramaswamy stop rapping his song ""Lose Yourself"" at campaign rallies, sending Ramaswamy a cease and desist letter."
Eminem,rapper,"Eminem endorsed Kamala Harris during the 2024 United States presidential election. In October, he spoke at a Huntington Place rally supporting her, where he discussed the importance of voting in a swing state like Michigan and his belief that Harris ""supports a future for this country"" in which freedom of expression is protected."
Eminem,rapper,=== Faith and beliefs ===

Eminem,rapper,=== Insane Clown Posse ===
Eminem,rapper,"The feud with fellow Detroit hip-hop duo Insane Clown Posse began in 1997, when Eminem was throwing a party to promote his debut EP, Slim Shady EP. He gave Joseph Bruce (aka Violent J from Insane Clown Posse) a flyer which stated ""Featuring appearances by Esham, Kid Rock, and ICP (maybe)"". Bruce asked why Eminem was promoting a possible Insane Clown Posse appearance without first contacting the group. Eminem explained, ""It says 'maybe.' Maybe you will be there; I don't know. That's why I'm asking you right now. You guys comin' to my release party, or what?"". Bruce, upset over not being consulted, responded, ""Fuck no, I ain't coming to your party. We might have, if you would've asked us first, before putting us on the fuckin' flyer like this."""
Eminem,rapper,"Eminem took Bruce's response as a personal offense, subsequently attacking the group in radio interviews. Bruce and Utsler responded with a parody of Eminem's ""My Name Is"" entitled ""Slim Anus"" and other tracks including ""Nuttin' But a Bitch Thang"" and ""Please Don't Hate Me"". Eminem insulted Insane Clown Posse on various tracks from his album The Marshall Mathers LP (2000), including ""Marshall Mathers"" and ""Ken Kaniff"". In 2002, Eminem briefly dissed them on his single ""Business"" from The Eminem Show."
Eminem,rapper,"Insane Clown Posse talked about the feud being squashed in an interview with MTV, saying that Proof squashed the conflict in 2005, which was followed by a bowling game between members of D12 and Psychopathic Records. Violent J stated that, ""He contacted us and we had a bowling game—it was really cool. We're something different. They could have skipped over us and said forget them, but they included us and said let's squash it."""
Eminem,rapper,=== Canibus ===
Eminem,rapper,"The animus with rapper Canibus started when Canibus and Haitian musician Wyclef Jean confronted Eminem and asked him if he had ghost-written the track ""The Ripper Strikes Back"" by LL Cool J. Eminem denied that he wrote the track. After he was confronted, Eminem said Canibus was ""rude"" to him."
Eminem,rapper,"Two years later, Canibus went to see Eminem on the Warped Tour and apologized to him for his reactions and asked him if he still wanted the track. Eminem agreed, but when he heard the track ""Phuck U"" from Canibus' album 2000 B.C., he thought the track was directed at him and LL Cool J. Shortly afterwards, Eminem released his third album The Marshall Mathers LP (2000) and Canibus decided to continue the ""story"" of Eminem's single ""Stan"". He titled the track ""U Didn't Care"" and it continued to take shots at Eminem. Eminem decided to take more shots at Canibus on his album The Eminem Show (2002) on tracks such as ""Say What You Say"", ""When The Music Stops"" and ""Square Dance"". Even though Canibus did not immediately respond to the tracks, Eminem continued to take shots at him, including ""My Name"", a track that Eminem was featured on from Xzibit's album Man vs. Machine (2002)."
Eminem,rapper,"On November 19, 2002, Canibus responded with the track titled ""Dr.‍C PhD"". Over a year later Eminem released the track ""Can-I-Bitch"". He attacked Canibus in a humorous matter. Since then the hostilities have cooled down, but Canibus tried to provoke a reignition of it when he leaked a track titled ""Air Strike (Pop Killer)"", that featured vocal parts of D12, where Canibus takes shots at Eminem and his deceased friend Proof. D12 member Swift responded to the record publicly and had the following to say about DZK (another rapper featured on the track). ""[He] asked us to do a track with him when he already was teamed up with Canibus without us knowing. They dissed Em, took our verses, and added them to the song, so they can bring traffic and make it seem like we were turning on Em [...] as a desperate attempt to be heard after ducking and dodging Em for 7 years. It was a straight hoe move."""
Eminem,rapper,=== Michael Jackson ===
Eminem,rapper,"The 2004 music video for ""Just Lose It"" generated controversy by parodying pop icon Michael Jackson's child molestation trial, plastic surgery and an incident in which Jackson's hair caught on fire while filming a Pepsi commercial in 1984. It was banned on the BET channel, after complaints from Benzino and others (but was later reinstated, as critics of the ban argued that Nelly's ""Tip Drill"" video could be seen). Both were only seen on BET: Uncut. However, MTV did not drop it, and the video became one of the most requested on the channel. A week after the release of ""Just Lose It"", Jackson called in to the radio show of Steve Harvey to report his displeasure with the video. ""I am very angry at Eminem's depiction of me in his video"", Jackson said in the interview. ""I feel that it is outrageous and disrespectful. It is one thing to spoof, but it is another to be demeaning and insensitive."" The singer continued: ""I've admired Eminem as an artist, and was shocked by this. The video was inappropriate and disrespectful to me, my children, my family and the community at large."" Many of Jackson's supporters and friends spoke out about the video, including Stevie Wonder, who called the video ""kicking a man while he's down"" and ""bullshit"", and Steve Harvey, who declared, ""Eminem has lost his ghetto pass. We want the pass back."""
Eminem,rapper,=== Ja Rule ===
Eminem,rapper,Eminem's conflict with rapper Ja Rule started after 50 Cent signed to Shady Records and Aftermath. Ja Rule stated that he had a problem with Eminem and Dr. Dre of signing someone he had conflict with.
Eminem,rapper,"On November 19, Ja Rule and Irv Gotti were special guests on Star and Bucwild's morning show on Hot 97 NYC. Gotti claimed to have ""legal documents"" referring to an order of protection 50 Cent ""has on him"". Ja Rule threatened, that if 50 Cent released any diss track, he would take action towards his two producers."
Eminem,rapper,"However, Dr. Dre was the one who produced 50 Cent's track ""Back Down"" in 2003 from the album Get Rich Or Die Tryin', which included lyrics insulting not only Murder Inc., but also Ja Rule's family including his then-two-year-old son and seven-year-old daughter Britney Atkins as in the song, 50 Cent raps, ""Your Mami, your Papi, that bitch you chasin' your lil dirty ass kids, I'll fuckin' erase them.""."
Eminem,rapper,"The feud intensified when Ja Rule released a diss called ""Loose Change"", in which he took shots at 50 Cent as well as Eminem (calling him ""Feminem"") and Dr. Dre (accuse him of being ""bisexual"" and having a fetish for transvestites – ""bringing transvestites home""). It includes also the lyrics insulting Eminem's family, including his then-seven-year-old daughter Hailie Jade: ""Em you claim your mother's a crack head and Kim is a known slut, so what's Hailie gonna be when she grows up?"". Eminem, along with D12 and Obie Trice, responded with the track ""Doe Rae Me"" (aka ""Hailie's Revenge"")."
Eminem,rapper,=== Benzino and The Source magazine ===
Eminem,rapper,"In 2003, rapper and The Source co-owner Benzino released a diss single titled ""Pull Your Skirt Up"" which took aim at Eminem. The track attacked Eminem's ""street cred"" and accused him of being a tool of the music industry. Eminem had been discovered by The Source after writer Rigo Morales featured him in the magazine's famed monthly ""Unsigned Hype"" column."
Eminem,rapper,"In the same year, The Source released an article written by Kimberly Osorio, which identified and researched the history of an old demo tape that the magazine discovered where Eminem insulted Black women. The demo featured a song called ""Foolish Pride"", recorded in the late 1980s when Eminem claimed to have been ""dumped"" by his African-American then-girlfriend. Eminem responded with two tracks titled ""Nail in the Coffin"" and ""The Sauce"". Benzino would later release more tracks. As a result of the conflict, Shady/Aftermath ads were pulled from the magazine. XXL, another hip-hop magazine which had featured negative coverage of Shady/Aftermath artists since Eminem mocked them in his song ""Marshall Mathers"" from his 2000 album The Marshall Mathers LP, stepped in to fill the void, accepting Shady/Aftermath ads."
Eminem,rapper,"In January 2024, Eminem reignited the feud with Benzino on a new diss track called ""Doomsday Pt. 2""."
Eminem,rapper,=== Mariah Carey and Nick Cannon ===
Eminem,rapper,"Eminem has written several songs referring to a relationship with R&B singer Mariah Carey, although she denies that they were ever intimate. Eminem has referenced her on many songs, including ""When the Music Stops"", ""Superman"", ""Jimmy Crack Corn"", ""Bagpipes from Baghdad"" and ""The Warning"". While ""Superman"" was released in 2003, Carey released a song entitled ""Clown"" on her album Charmbracelet, released in 2002, which makes similar references in line with her 2009 hit ""Obsessed""."
Eminem,rapper,"Eminem's ""Bagpipes from Baghdad"" from his album Relapse disparages Carey and rapper/then-husband Nick Cannon's relationship. Cannon responded to Eminem by saying his career is based on ""racist bigotry"" and that he would get revenge on Eminem, joking that he may return to rapping. Eminem later stated that the couple misinterpreted the track and it was wishing the two the best. Cannon also stated that there were no hard feelings and that he just had to express his feelings about the song."
Eminem,rapper,"In 2009, Carey released ""Obsessed"", about an obsessed man who claims to have been in a relationship with her. Cannon claimed that the song was not an insult directed at Eminem. However, Eminem responded in late July 2009 by releasing a track titled ""The Warning"". It contained samples of voice mail recordings which Eminem claimed were left by Carey, when the two were dating. Eminem also hinted that he had other evidence of their relationship in his possession. A little over a year later in September 2010, Cannon responded with the song ""I'm a Slick Rick"", making fun of Eminem."
Eminem,rapper,=== Moby ===
Eminem,rapper,"After the release of Eminem's 2000 album The Marshall Mathers LP, popular electronic music artist Moby began speaking out against the album's lyrics, condemning references to misogyny and homophobia as unacceptable. Eminem responded back with insulting Moby in ""Without Me"", the lead single off his next album The Eminem Show."
Eminem,rapper,"In 2004, Moby praised Eminem for criticizing then-U.S. president George W. Bush in the song ""Mosh"", a track from Encore. The feud has since ended. In 2022, Eminem said that he later regretted attacking Moby."
Eminem,rapper,=== Machine Gun Kelly ===
Eminem,rapper,"Eminem and rapper Machine Gun Kelly have had an ongoing feud for several years. The feud started by Machine Gun Kelly saying in a tweet that Hailie was ""hot"". He was banned from Shade 45 because of the tweet. Kelly released a diss track titled ""Rap Devil"" in September 2018, in response to Eminem's track ""Not Alike""; both songs were produced by Ronny J. Kelly continued the feud at a concert, calling it ""a battle between the past and the fucking future"". The song's title refers to Eminem's ""Rap God"" and Eminem went into the studio days later to record his own response, as did former D12 associate Bizarre. Eminem responded with ""Killshot"" on September 14 and Bizarre's ""Love Tap"" was released on September 20. ""Killshot"" garnered 38.1 million streams on YouTube in its first 24 hours and over 80 million views in its first week, making it the most successful debut for a hip-hop song and the third-biggest debut in the platform's history. The track also debuted at number 3 on the Billboard Hot 100, making it Eminem's 20th top 10 hit on the Billboard Hot 100. Kelly has continued the feud publicly."
Eminem,rapper,=== From Kamikaze ===
Eminem,rapper,"Throughout the 2018 album Kamikaze Eminem's lyrics criticize other musicians, primarily mumble rappers, and several have responded publicly. Ja Rule responded on social media, re-igniting a feud the two had 15 years prior. 6ix9ine, Iggy Azalea, Joe Budden, Die Antwoord, Lupe Fiasco, and Lord Jamar have also responded publicly, with 6ix9ine releasing the skit ""Legend"" that raps over Eminem's ""Lose Yourself""."
Eminem,rapper,== Controversies ==
Eminem,rapper,=== Legal issues ===
Eminem,rapper,"Eminem had his first run-in with the law at age 20, when he was arrested for his involvement in a drive-by shooting with a paintball gun. The case was dismissed when the victim did not appear in court.: 3 "
Eminem,rapper,"On June 3, 2000, Eminem was arrested during an altercation with Douglas Dail, an employee of Insane Clown Posse's record label, at a car-audio store in Royal Oak, Michigan, when Eminem pulled out an unloaded gun and pointed it at the ground. The next day, in Warren, Michigan, he was arrested again for assaulting a man in the parking lot of the Hot Rocks Café when he saw the man kissing Eminem's wife. Eminem recreated the Guerra assault in ""The Kiss (Skit)"" on The Eminem Show. He pleaded guilty to possession of a concealed weapon, receiving two years' probation; a charge of assault using a dangerous weapon was dropped as part of the plea agreement. On June 28, 2001, Eminem was sentenced to one year's probation and community service and was fined about $2,000 on weapon charges stemming from an argument with an employee of Psychopathic Records."
Eminem,rapper,"In 1999, Eminem's mother sued him for $10 million, claiming he was slandering her on The Slim Shady LP. Litigation concluded in 2001, resulting in an award of $1,600 for her damages.: 69 "
Eminem,rapper,"On July 7, 2000, Kim Mathers attempted suicide by slitting her wrists, later suing Eminem for defamation after describing her violent death in ""Kim""."
Eminem,rapper,"Sanitation worker DeAngelo Bailey sued Eminem for $1 million in 2001, accusing him of invading his privacy by publicizing information placing Bailey in a false light in ""Brain Damage"", a song that portrays him as a violent school bully. Although Bailey admitted picking on Eminem in school, he said he merely ""bumped"" Eminem and gave him a ""little shove"". The lawsuit was dismissed on October 20, 2003; Judge Deborah Servitto, who wrote a portion of her opinion in rap-like rhyming verse, ruled that it was clear to the public that the lyrics were exaggerated."
Eminem,rapper,"On March 31, 2002, French jazz pianist Jacques Loussier filed a $10 million lawsuit against Eminem and Dr. Dre, claiming that the beat for ""Kill You"" was taken from his instrumental ""Pulsion"". Loussier demanded that sales of The Marshall Mathers LP be halted and any remaining copies destroyed. The case was later settled out of court."
Eminem,rapper,"In 2006, Eminem was accused of assaulting Miad Jarbou, a resident of Royal Oak, Michigan, in the bathroom of a Detroit strip club, but was never charged. Two years later, Jarbou sued Eminem for more than $25,000 in damages."
Eminem,rapper,"In 2007, Eminem's music-publishing company (Eight Mile Style) and Martin Affiliated sued Apple Inc. and Aftermath Entertainment, claiming that Aftermath was not authorized to negotiate a deal with Apple for digital downloads of 93 Eminem songs on Apple's iTunes. The case against Apple was settled shortly after the trial began, in late September 2009."
Eminem,rapper,"In July 2010, the United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit ruled in F.B.T. Productions, LLC v. Aftermath Records that F.B.T. Productions and Eminem were owed a royalty of 50 percent of Aftermath's net revenue from licensing his recordings to companies such as Apple, Sprint Corporation, Nextel Communications, Cingular and T-Mobile. In March 2011, the Supreme Court of the United States declined to hear the case."
Eminem,rapper,"In October 2013, Eminem sampled Chicago-based rap group Hotstylz's 2008 viral hit, ""Lookin' Boy"", for his 2013 hit single ""Rap God"". The group claims that Eminem did not receive permission to use the sample, nor did he credit or compensate them. In November 2013, Hotstylz released a diss track towards Eminem titled ""Rap Fraud"", where they sample several of his songs and criticize him for not crediting them. In January 2015, TMZ reported that Hotstylz was suing Eminem and his label, Shady Records, for $8 million, for using the 25-second sample of ""Lookin' Boy"" on his song ""Rap God"" without their permission."
Eminem,rapper,=== United States Secret Service ===
Eminem,rapper,"On December 8, 2003, the United States Secret Service reported that it was ""looking into"" allegations that Eminem threatened U.S. president George W. Bush in ""We As Americans"" (an unreleased bootleg at the time), with the lyrics: ""Fuck money, I don't rap for dead presidents. I'd rather see the president dead, it's never been said but I set precedents."" The incident was included in the video for ""Mosh"", as a newspaper clipping on a wall with articles about unfortunate incidents in Bush's career. ""We As Americans"" eventually appeared on Encore's deluxe-edition bonus disc with altered lyrics. The original lyrics can be heard at the end of Immortal Technique's ""Bin Laden""."
Eminem,rapper,"In 2018–2019, the Secret Service interviewed Eminem again regarding threatening lyrics towards president Donald Trump and his daughter Ivanka."
Eminem,rapper,=== Allegations of homophobia ===
Eminem,rapper,"Some of Eminem's lyrics have been criticized for being homophobic, and an Australian politician attempted to ban him from the country. Eminem denies the charge, saying that when he was growing up words such as ""faggot"" and ""queer"" were used generally in a derogatory manner and not specifically toward homosexuals. During a 2010 60 Minutes interview, journalist Anderson Cooper explored the issue:"
Eminem,rapper,"In 2013, Eminem was accused of homophobia due to the lyrics of the song ""Rap God"", explaining to Rolling Stone, ""I don't know how to say this without saying it how I've said it a million times. But that word, those kind of words, when I came up battle-rappin' or whatever, I never really equated those words ... (to actually mean homosexual)""."
Eminem,rapper,"In 2018, Eminem was criticized for using the word ""faggot"" against Tyler, the Creator in the song ""Fall"". Eminem later apologized for using the homophobic slur, saying he went ""too far"". Discussing the issue in a multi-part interview with radio host Sway, Eminem explained that while he meant to stand up for himself, ""I think the word that I called him on that song was one of the things where I felt like, 'This might be too far.'"" He added, ""Because in my quest to hurt him [Tyler], I realize that I was hurting a lot of other people by saying it."""
Eminem,rapper,"Eminem is a friend of openly gay singer Elton John, and publicly supports gay rights. When asked in an interview with The New York Times about the subject of same-sex marriage being legalized in his home state of Michigan, Eminem responded, ""I think if two people love each other, then what the hell? I think that everyone should have the chance to be equally miserable, if they want"", explaining that his ""overall look on things is a lot more mature than it used to be""."
Eminem,rapper,== Achievements and honors ==

Kendrick Lamar,rapper,"Kendrick Lamar Duckworth (born June 17, 1987) is an American rapper. Regarded as one of the greatest rappers of all time, he was awarded the 2018 Pulitzer Prize for Music, becoming the first musician outside of the classical and jazz genres to receive the honor."
Kendrick Lamar,rapper,"Born in Compton, California, Lamar began releasing music under the stage name K.Dot while attending high school. He signed with Top Dawg Entertainment (TDE) in 2005, and co-founded the hip hop supergroup Black Hippy there. Following the 2011 release of his alternative rap debut album Section.80, Lamar secured a joint contract with Dr. Dre's Aftermath Entertainment and Interscope Records. He rose to fame with his gangsta rap-influenced second album Good Kid, M.A.A.D City (2012), which became the longest-charting hip hop studio album in Billboard 200 history. In 2015, Lamar scored his first Billboard Hot 100 number-one single, after featuring on the remix of Taylor Swift's ""Bad Blood"", and released his third album, To Pimp a Butterfly, which infused hip-hop with historical African-American music genres such as jazz, funk, and soul, and became his first of six consecutive number-one albums on the Billboard 200 chart."
Kendrick Lamar,rapper,"Lamar's critical and commercial success continued with his R&B and pop-leaning fourth album Damn (2017), yielding his second US number-one single, ""Humble"". He curated original songs for the soundtrack of the 2018 film Black Panther, earning a nomination for the Academy Award for Best Original Song for the US top-ten single ""All the Stars"". Lamar's 2022 double album Mr. Morale & the Big Steppers concluded his tenure with TDE and Aftermath. His 2024 feud with Drake spawned the US number-ones ""Like That"" and ""Not Like Us"", with the latter tying the record for the most-awarded song in Grammy history with five wins, including Record of the Year and Song of the Year. His sixth album, GNX (2024), produced his fifth US number-one single, ""Squabble Up"", as well as ""TV Off"" and ""Luther"", which both peaked at number two."
Kendrick Lamar,rapper,"Lamar has received various accolades, including 22 Grammy Awards (the third-most won by a rapper), a Primetime Emmy Award, a Brit Award, 4 American Music Awards, 7 Billboard Music Awards, 11 MTV Video Music Awards (including 2 Video of the Year wins), and a record 37 BET Hip Hop Awards. Time listed him as one of the 100 most influential people in the world in 2016. Three of his works were included in Rolling Stone's 2020 revision of the 500 Greatest Albums of All Time. His Super Bowl LIX halftime show in 2025 broke viewership records, with 133.5 million viewers domestically. Outside of music, Lamar co-founded the creative company PGLang and ventured into film with his longtime creative partner, Dave Free."
Kendrick Lamar,rapper,== Early life ==
Kendrick Lamar,rapper,"Kendrick Lamar Duckworth was born on June 17, 1987, in Compton, California. He is the first child of former gang hustler Kenneth ""Kenny"" Duckworth and hairdresser Paula Oliver. Both of his parents are African Americans from the South Side of Chicago. When they were teenagers, they relocated to Compton in 1984, due to his father's affiliation with the Gangster Disciples. Lamar was named after singer-songwriter Eddie Kendricks of the Temptations. He was an only child until the age of seven and was described as a loner by his mother. Eventually, his parents had his two younger brothers and younger sister, businesswoman Kayla Sawyer (née Duckworth). His cousins include basketball player Nick Young and rapper Baby Keem."
Kendrick Lamar,rapper,"Lamar and his family lived in Section 8 housing, were reliant on welfare and food stamps, and experienced homelessness. Although he is not a member of a particular gang, he grew up with close affiliates of the Westside Pirus. Despite suffering hardships, Lamar remembered having ""good memories"" of his childhood that sparked his interest in hip hop music, such as sneaking into his parents' house parties. He was raised secular, although he occasionally attended church services and was taught the Bible by his grandmother. He felt ""spiritually unsatisfied"" as a child due to the ""empty"" and ""one-sided"" nature of the sermons."
Kendrick Lamar,rapper,"After hearing a recording of his voice for the first time, Lamar became interested in rapping. He was introduced to police brutality after experiencing the first day of the 1992 Los Angeles riots. When he was five years old, he witnessed a murder for the first time while sitting outside of his apartment unit, as a teenage drug dealer was killed in a drive-by shooting. ""It done [sic] something to me right then and there,"" Lamar later admitted to NPR Music. ""It let me know that this is not only something that I'm looking at, but it's something that maybe I have to get used to."" His parents nicknamed him ""Man-Man"" due to his precocious behavior, although he confessed it ""put a stigma on the idea of me reacting as a kid sometimes—I would hurt myself and they would expect me not to cry."""
Kendrick Lamar,rapper,"In school, Lamar was a quiet and observant student who excelled academically and had a noticeable stutter. His first grade teacher at Robert E. McNair Elementary School encouraged him to become a writer after she heard him correctly use the word ""audacity"". As a seventh grade student at Vanguard Learning Center, Lamar was introduced to poetry by his English teacher, Regis Inge. Inge integrated the literary form into his curriculum as a response to the growing racial tensions amongst his students. Through its connection to hip hop, Lamar studied rhymes, metaphors and double entendres, which made him fall in love with songwriting: ""You can put all your feelings down on a sheet of paper, and they'd make sense to you. I liked that."" Instead of completing assignments for other classes, Lamar would scribe lyrics in his notebooks. His initial writing was entirely profane, but it helped him manage his psychological trauma and depression, which he struggled with during his adolescence. Inge played a vital role in his intellectual growth, often critiquing his lexicon and suggesting prompts to strengthen his prose."
Kendrick Lamar,rapper,"Lamar later attended Centennial High School. He was enrolled in summer school during the tenth grade, which he dreaded because it forced him to be embroiled in a gang war. Despite his efforts to avoid them, Lamar soon became heavily involved with Compton's hedonistic gang culture, which led to numerous health scares and encounters with the police. He distanced himself from the lifestyle following an intervention staged by his father. When he was 16, Lamar was baptized and converted to Christianity following the death of a friend. He graduated from high school in 2005 as a straight-A student. He considered studying psychology and astronomy in college, but suspended his academic pursuits to focus on his music career."
Kendrick Lamar,rapper,== Career ==
Kendrick Lamar,rapper,=== 2003–2008: Beginnings ===
Kendrick Lamar,rapper,"During high school, Lamar adopted the stage name K.Dot and began freestyling and battle rapping at school. His performances caught the attention of fellow student Dave Free, who traveled from Inglewood to watch him rap. They quickly formed a friendship over their love of hip-hop and the television sitcom Martin. They recorded music together at Free's makeshift garage studio and at his older brother's Hyde Park apartment. Lamar's earliest performances were held at a ""super hood"" comedy club and behind a tattoo parlor. Free was his hype man during that time, while his older brother was his manager and disc jockey. Lamar recorded five mixtapes throughout the 2000s; his first, Youngest Head Nigga in Charge (Hub City Threat: Minor of the Year), was released on April 15, 2003, through Konkrete Jungle Musik. The mixtapes primarily consisted of freestyles over the production of popular hip-hop songs."
Kendrick Lamar,rapper,"In a series of retrospective reviews for Rolling Stone, Mosi Reeves complimented Lamar's ""unerring"" sense of rhythm and timing found in Hub City Threat: Minor of the Year, but criticized his ""clumsy"" lyricism and that his flow was ""overly beholden to ... Jay-Z and Lil Wayne"". Free, who was working as a computer technician, introduced the mixtape to record producer Anthony ""Top Dawg"" Tiffith while attempting to repair his computer. Tiffith was impressed with Lamar's burgeoning abilities and invited him to partake in an audition process for entry into his newly established independent record label, Top Dawg Entertainment (TDE). During his audition, Lamar freestyled for Tiffith and record executive Terrence ""Punch"" Henderson for two hours, a strategy that impressed Henderson but bewildered Tiffith. He was offered a recording contract by TDE in 2005, joining Jay Rock as the label's first signings. Upon signing, he purchased a minority stake in the label for an undisclosed amount."
Kendrick Lamar,rapper,"Lamar had a brief stint as a security guard when he started working on music with Jay Rock at TDE's in-house recording studio. The bond he formed with him, Ab-Soul and Schoolboy Q led to the formation of the hip-hop supergroup, Black Hippy. Lamar released his second mixtape, Training Day, on December 30, 2005. Reeves complemented its varied production and ""well-executed"" concept, which was based on the 2001 film. In 2006, Lamar signed an artist development deal with Def Jam Recordings and was featured on two singles by the Game. He also heavily contributed to Jay Rock's first two mixtapes, Watts Finest Vol. 1 and Watts Finest Vol. 2: The Nickerson Files. Lamar was ultimately let go from Def Jam after an encounter with its president and chief executive officer, Jay-Z; he later described it as ""one of those situations where I wasn't ready."" Lamar and Jay Rock released a collaborative mixtape, title No Sleep 'til NYC, on December 24, 2007. Reeves thought the project was a ""fun cypher session, nothing more, nothing less."""
Kendrick Lamar,rapper,=== 2009–2011: Overly Dedicated and Section.80 ===
Kendrick Lamar,rapper,"Lamar's third mixtape C4, released on January 30, 2009, is a tribute project to Lil Wayne's Tha Carter III (2008) and was supported by his co-sign. Reeves felt that the mixtape was a ""wrongheaded homage to a year-old, well-worn album."" From February to July, he toured with the Game on his LAX Tour as a hype man for Jay Rock. Lamar disliked how his stage name diverted attention away from his true identity, and decided to retire it. He opted to use his first and middle names professionally and regards the name change as part of his career growth. For his eponymous debut extended play (2009), Lamar eschewed the creative process of his mixtapes in favor of a project heavily focused on his songwriting over ""lovely yet doleful"" production. Reeves described the EP as the ""first standout project"" of his career, praising its melancholic tone. He felt that the project restored his reputation following the sting of criticism he received over C4."
Kendrick Lamar,rapper,"After striking a music publishing deal with Warner/Chappell Music, Lamar released his fourth mixtape, Overly Dedicated, on September 14, 2010. It was his first project to be purchased through digital retailers. Reeves described Overly Dedicated as a partial ""victory lap"" that marked a shift in his songwriting. The mixtape peaked at number 72 on Billboard's Top R&B/Hip-Hop Albums chart. Lamar served as Jay Rock's hype man for a second time during Tech N9ne's Independent Grind Tour, where Overly Dedicated was introduced to Dr. Dre. After watching the music video for the song ""Ignorance Is Bliss"" on YouTube, he reached out to Lamar with hopes of working with him and Snoop Dogg on his unfinished album, Detox. He also considered signing him to his record label, Aftermath Entertainment, and was encouraged to by artists such as J. Cole."
Kendrick Lamar,rapper,"Lamar entered a brief relationship with Nitty Scott, and was featured on XXL's 2011 Freshman Class list. He released his debut studio album, Section.80, on July 2, 2011, which was supported by its lead single ""HiiiPower"". The album explored conscious and alternative hip-hop styles and experimented with ""stripped-down"" jazz production. Ogden Payne of Forbes considers it to be ""the genesis to [Lamar] successfully balancing social commentary with mass appeal."" Section.80 marked Lamar's first appearance on the Billboard 200 chart, where it peaked at number 113. It sold approximately 5,000 copies in its first week of tracking, with minimal coverage from mainstream media outlets. To promote the album, Lamar performed at small venues and college campuses across the U.S. He was dubbed the ""New King of the West Coast"" by Snoop Dogg, Dr. Dre and the Game during a performance in West Los Angeles. Throughout the year, he appeared on the Game's The R.E.D. Album, Tech N9ne's All 6's and 7's, 9th Wonder's The Wonder Years, and Drake's Take Care."
Kendrick Lamar,rapper,"=== 2012–2013: Good Kid, M.A.A.D City ==="
Kendrick Lamar,rapper,"Lamar began planning his second album before Section.80 was released. From February to April 2012, he opened for Drake on his Club Paradise Tour. He began working with J. Cole on a collaborative album around that time. On March 8, The Fader reported that Lamar had signed a joint venture recording contract with Aftermath Entertainment and Interscope Records; under the deal, TDE continued to serve as his primary label. His first commercial single, ""The Recipe"" featuring Dr. Dre, premiered on rhythmic crossover radio on April 2."
Kendrick Lamar,rapper,"Good Kid, M.A.A.D City, Lamar's second album and first under a major record label, was released on October 22, 2012. He worked with producers such as Pharrell Williams, Hit-Boy, Scoop DeVille, Jack Splash, and T-Minus to create an atmospheric West Coast hip-hop album with heavy gangsta rap influences. Its lead single, ""Swimming Pools (Drank)"", marked Lamar's first top 20 single on the U.S. Billboard Hot 100. Its other singles, ""Backseat Freestyle"", ""Poetic Justice"", and ""Bitch, Don't Kill My Vibe"", enjoyed moderate commercial success. Good Kid, M.A.A.D City was met with widespread critical acclaim, who lauded Lamar's nonlinear songwriting and thematic scope. Greg Kot of the Chicago Tribune applauded him for giving gangsta tropes a ""twist, or sometimes upend[ing] them completely"" on a record that ""brims with comedy, complexity and the many voices in [Lamar's] head."" The album debuted at number two on the Billboard 200 with 242,000 copies sold; the highest first-week album sales of the year by a male rapper. Good Kid, M.A.A.D City surpassed The Eminem Show (2002) to become the longest-charting hip-hop studio album on the Billboard 200. In October 2022, it became the first hip-hop studio album to spend over ten consecutive years on the chart."
Kendrick Lamar,rapper,"From September to October 2012, Lamar headlined the BET Music Matters Tour with Black Hippy and Stalley. He won Lyricist of the Year at the BET Hip Hop Awards, and was featured on ASAP Rocky's single ""Fuckin' Problems"" alongside Drake and 2 Chainz, which reached the top 10 in the U.S. Lamar embarked on two headlining concert tours in 2013: a national college tour with Steve Aoki and his first international tour. He struggled with depression, survivor's guilt and suicidal ideation during promotional events upon learning of the deaths of three close friends. From October to December 2013, Lamar opened for Kanye West on his Yeezus Tour, despite disapproval from his label and management team. He was baptized for a second time during the beginning of the tour, and experienced a nervous breakdown near the end. Lamar won three awards each during the BET Awards and BET Hip Hop Awards, including Best New Artist at the former."
Kendrick Lamar,rapper,"Lamar was featured on six songs throughout the year: ""YOLO"" by the Lonely Island featuring Adam Levine, the remix of ""How Many Drinks?"" by Miguel, ""Collard Greens"" by Schoolboy Q, ""Control"" with Big Sean and Jay Electronica, ""Give It 2 U"" by Robin Thicke featuring 2 Chainz, and ""Love Game"" by Eminem. His performance on ""Control"" was described as a ""wake up call"" for the hip-hop industry and commenced his decade-long feud with Drake. Rolling Stone noted that his verse made the track one of the most important hip-hop songs of the last decade. Lamar was named Rapper of the Year by GQ during their annual Men of the Year edition. Following the issue's release, Tiffith pulled him from performing at GQ's accompanying party and accused Steve Marsh's profile on him of containing ""racial overtones""."
Kendrick Lamar,rapper,=== 2014–2016: To Pimp a Butterfly and Untitled Unmastered ===

He earned seven nominations at the 56th Annual Grammy Awards (January 2014), including Best New Artist, Best Rap Album, and Album of the Year for Good Kid, M.A.A.D City. He was winless at the ceremony, which several media outlets felt was a snub. Macklemore, who won Best New Artist and Best Rap Album, shared a text message that he sent Lamar after the ceremony ended, in which he apologized for winning over him. The incident was the subject of widespread media attention, controversy and Internet memes. During the awards ceremony, Lamar performed a mashup of ""M.A.A.D City"" and ""Radioactive"" with rock band Imagine Dragons, which was met with critical acclaim."

Kendrick Lamar,rapper,"Originally scheduled to arrive at a later date, To Pimp a Butterfly was released on March 15, 2015. The album incorporated various genres synonymous with African American music, such as jazz, funk, and soul. To capture its essence, Lamar recruited producers such as Sounwave, Pharrell Williams, Terrace Martin, and Thundercat. Whitney Alford, Lamar's fianceé, contributed background vocals on select tracks. Other singles from the album were ""The Blacker the Berry"", ""King Kunta"", ""Alright"", and ""These Walls""–all of which enjoyed moderate commercial success. Selling 324,000 copies in its first week, To Pimp a Butterfly became Lamar's first number-one album on the Billboard 200 and the UK Albums Chart. Billboard commented that ""twenty years ago, a conscious rap record wouldn't have penetrated the mainstream in the way [Lamar] did with To Pimp a Butterfly. His sense of timing is impeccable. In the midst of rampant cases of police brutality and racial tension across America, he spews raw, aggressive bard while possible cutting a rug."" Pitchfork opined that the album ""forced critics to think deeply about music."""
Kendrick Lamar,rapper,"He earned his first number-one single in the U.S. through the remix of singer-songwriter Taylor Swift's ""Bad Blood"". It won Video of the Year and Best Collaboration at the MTV Video Music Awards, while the music video for ""Alright"" won Best Direction. Lamar later re-recorded his featured appearance on the ""Bad Blood"" remix in support of Swift's counteraction to her masters dispute.

He released the promotional single ""The Heart Part 4"" on March 23, before releasing the album's lead single ""Humble"" on March 30. The song debuted at number two on the Hot 100 and reached the top spot in its second week of charting. It is Lamar's second single, and first as a lead artist, to top the chart. Damn was released on April 14. It utilized a more mainstream musical palette than To Pimp a Butterfly, exploring R&B and pop elements. Rolling Stone described its sonics as a ""brilliant combination of the timeless and the modern, the old school and the next-level."" Damn became Lamar's most commercially successful album. It spent four non-consecutive weeks atop the Billboard 200, marking his third consecutive number-one album, and debuted with 603,000 units sold.

Music critics consider Black Panther: The Album to be a milestone achievement, giving praise towards its lyrics and cultural significance. It spent two consecutive weeks atop the Billboard 200, and earned the most single-week streams for a soundtrack album in history. Lamar opened the 60th Annual Grammy Awards with a critically acclaimed medley. He won five awards during the ceremony: Damn was named Best Rap Album, ""Humble"" won Best Rap Performance, Best Rap Song, and Best Music Video and ""Loyalty"" won Best Rap/Sung Performance.

Kendrick Lamar,rapper,"From May to June 2018, Lamar co-headlined the Championship Tour with several TDE artists.

Kendrick Lamar,rapper,"=== 2024–present: Feud with Drake, GNX, Grammy wins and Super Bowl LIX halftime show ==="

They welcomed their first child, Uzi, on July 26, 2019. The couple used the cover art for Mr. Morale & the Big Steppers to announce the birth of their son, Enoch, in 2022."
Kendrick Lamar,rapper,"Lamar is a teetotaler and lives a drug-free lifestyle. In an October 2012 interview, he stated that he once tried marijuana, but the blunt had been laced with Angel Dust and he has not used any drugs since. In an interview with Starz, Lamar stated he asked to play a drug abuser on the TV series Power, saying: ""[Laces] is just a character that I know. I know so well, just growing up in Compton. You grow this type of love for them, you know, in this weird kind of way. You know, you don't want to see nothing happen to them, but you know he's dangerous."""
Kendrick Lamar,rapper,== Artistry ==
Kendrick Lamar,rapper,=== Influences ===
Kendrick Lamar,rapper,"Tupac Shakur is Lamar's biggest influence, having impacted both his professional and personal lives. One of his earliest childhood memories is watching him and Dr. Dre film the second music video for their single ""California Love"" with his father at the Compton Swap Meet. Lamar has described himself as an ""offspring"" of Shakur's artistry and sociopolitical views. Although some publications have regarded him as the Shakur of his generation, he has strived to maintain his individuality."
Kendrick Lamar,rapper,"Shakur's The Don Killuminati: The 7 Day Theory (1996), The Notorious B.I.G.'s Life After Death (1997), and DMX's It's Dark and Hell is Hot (1998) influenced Lamar's artistic direction: ""I don't look at these albums like just music; it sounds like an actual film."" He also listened and took influence from Mos Def and Snoop Dogg during his childhood, and said, ""I wouldn't be here today if it wasn't for Eazy-E."" 50 Cent's mixtape success inspired Lamar to become an independent artist, while his view on being categorized as a conscious rapper, ""Yeah, I'm a conscious artist because I have a conscience"", gave him a sense of perspective."
Kendrick Lamar,rapper,"Prodigy of Mobb Deep was a key influence on Lamar's earlier mixtapes, while his rapping technique was stemmed from Lil Wayne and his longevity. Eminem and his album The Marshall Mathers LP (2000) introduced him to songwriting elements, such as ad-libs, and impacted his aggressive approach to records such as ""Backseat Freestyle"". He took inspiration from N.W.A's tenacity of representing his hometown with ""courage, honesty and artistic brilliance"". Various R&B and soul artists, including Marvin Gaye, the Isley Brothers, Michael Jackson, Teddy Pendergrass, Sade, and Anita Baker, have influenced Lamar. He performed with Prince, who impacted his vocal register, at Paisley Park to celebrate the release of the latter's 2014 albums Plectrumelectrum and Art Official Age, which GQ described as ""five minutes of brilliant insanity"". To Pimp a Butterfly was influenced by the works of jazz trumpeter Miles Davis and funk collective Parliament-Funkadelic."
Kendrick Lamar,rapper,=== Musical style ===
Kendrick Lamar,rapper,"The nature of Lamar's musical style has been described as ""anti-flamboyant, interior and complex."" He is rooted in West Coast hip hop, and has continually reinvented his sound by branching out into other genres. Due to his contributions to its audience growth, through his appeal to mainstream listeners, music critics generally categorize Lamar as a progressive rap artist. He suggests that his music is genreless, explaining in a 2012 interview, ""You really can't categorize my music, it's human music."" PopDust opined that during the 2010s, a decade that was arguably defined by hip hop, Lamar constantly pushed the boundaries of what the genre could be."
Kendrick Lamar,rapper,"Lamar did not care for music production during the beginning of his career. However, as he placed an emphasis on songwriting and ""making material that's universal"", he grew more exacting and adventurous with his compositions. He is heavily involved with every aspect of his production process, including the mixing and mastering stages, and is known for working long hours in the recording studio. ""You gotta be hands on and know the different sounds and frequencies,"" Lamar explained to Variety. ""What makes people move, what melodies stick with you, taking the higher octaves and the lower octaves and learning how to intertwine that in a certain frequency, how to manipulate sound to your advantage."" Lamar chooses to work with a close-knit team of musicians, rather than constantly seek high-profile talent. He has been working with his longtime producer, Sounwave, since his 2009 self-titled EP."
Kendrick Lamar,rapper,"Kendrick Lamar marked a pivotal change in Lamar's artistry. Unlike his earlier mixtapes, which consisted of freestyles over CHR and urban radio singles, the EP incorporated melancholic and ""doleful"" original production that emphasized his lyrics. Austere jazz production was blended with alternative rap styles on Section.80, with instrumentals drawing from R&B, boom bap, psychedelia, and downtempo. Good Kid, M.A.A.D City abandoned the tastes of contemporary hip hop by exploring a subtle, atmospheric side of West Coast hip hop and gangsta rap. To Pimp a Butterfly is an amalgamation of genres synonymous with African-American music, most prominently jazz, funk, and soul. It redefined jazz rap by highlighting improvisation and soloing rather than primarily using sampling. Minimalist arrangements are incorporated in Damn and Mr. Morale & the Big Steppers. Damn appealed to mainstream listeners through its pop and R&B-influenced production, while the scattered and distorted instrumentals of Mr. Morale & the Big Steppers was designed to make listeners feel anxious and uncomfortable. GNX was an homage to the West Coast, with g-funk synths, West Coast-inspired beats and flows, and features from various underground Los Angeles rappers such as Hitta J3, YoungThreat, Peysoh, Lefty Gunplay, Wallei the Sensei, and Siete7x."
Kendrick Lamar,rapper,=== Voice ===
Kendrick Lamar,rapper,"Several media outlets consider Lamar to be the greatest and most important rapper of his generation. Billboard, Forbes and Vibe named him the second-greatest rapper of all time, behind Jay-Z. Described as a ""blazing"" technical rapper and ""relentless searcher"" by The New York Times, Lamar's ""limber, dexterous"" flow switches from derivative to generative metrics, while incorporating internal and multisyllabic rhyme schemes. His rhymes are typically manipulated within common time, allowing him to subtly control his metrical phonology and suggest formal ambiguities similar to pop and rock repertoires. Some of his rhyme manipulations feature ""flexible"" new school styles evoking the 1990s, while others use ""rigid"" old school elements recalling the 1980s. Lamar frequently uses syncopation in his melodies to create contradictions between his lyrical content and rhythms. With Good Kid, M.A.A.D City, he liberally plays with pronunciation, inflections, and delivery to mirror the album's emotional range."
Kendrick Lamar,rapper,"Lamar possesses a versatile tenor vocal range and a raspy, half-shout timbre, where ""his throat sounds dry and his mouth sounds wet."" André 3000 was the first rapper that introduced him to singing sensibilities in hip hop, and he writes melody-driven songs as practice for his albums. Lamar became comfortable with his vocals over time, to the point where he feels confident enough to create singing-based albums. Pitchfork noticed how his harmonies on To Pimp a Butterfly never made him sound alone throughout his ""desolate"" performance; comparing his vocal layering to ""standing in the middle, unnoticed, of a large quarrelsome crowd."""
Kendrick Lamar,rapper,"Praised for his willingness to use his voice as an instrument, Lamar adopts different cadences, tones, modulations, and timbres to suggest conflicting personalities, paint distinct emotions, and communicate stories using characters and personas. His falsetto register, which he calls the ""ghetto falsetto"", has been likened to Curtis Mayfield's. MTV writes that by manipulating his voice, Lamar calls back to a lineage that runs through James Brown's foundational work in the 1960s, 1970s psychedelia, Prince's ""sweaty"" phantasmagoria in the 1980s, and 1990s gangsta rap. He was ranked the tenth-best solo singer of the 21st century by The Times in 2023."
Kendrick Lamar,rapper,=== Songwriting ===
Kendrick Lamar,rapper,"Branded as a ""master of storytelling"" by The New Yorker, Lamar has been referred to as one of the greatest lyricists in modern hip hop by several publications and his peers. Pharrell Williams suggests that what makes his songwriting stand out is because he ""knows how to be very disciplined with a subject matter, he knows that stickiness is important, and he knows that it has to be great."" American Songwriter notes that for as much as Lamar is a musician, lyricist, and emcee, he is also ""a playwright, a novelist, a short story author. He's literary within the art form of music."" Lamar's reflective narrative songwriting pulls from a wide range of literary and cinematic techniques, such as hip hop skits and voice-overs, to allow his audience to follow internal and external storylines. His fusion of various film styles and his sonic influence has elevated his works to be some of the most ""consistently poignant"" in hip hop, and promoted the advancement of the narrative device."
Kendrick Lamar,rapper,"Lamar, who self-identifies as a musician and writer, begins his songwriting process with an assortment of premeditated thoughts that he jotted down over the course of one year. His personal experiences are a common source of inspiration, but he also pulls ideas from meeting new people, traveling, and experiencing different cultures. A devout Christian, he additionally shares his spiritual triumphs and struggles on his songs. He is an avid note-taker, and has developed keywords, phrases, and sounds to help him ""trigger the exact emotions"" he felt when writing the initial demo. Considered to be a ""radio-friendly but overtly political rapper"" by Pitchfork, and a populist by The Wall Street Journal, Lamar's songwriting regularly infuses political criticism and social commentary concerning African-American culture. Common themes explored include racial inequality, institutional discrimination, and black empowerment. Lamar's critiques has been compared to the State of the Union Address by The Guardian, while Billboard described it as ""Shakespearean"". HuffPost opined that his work is a ""great"" piece of journalism because it ""speaks from the prerogative of black communities facing oppression and directly attacks the institutions responsible for their pain,"" an achievement most reporters cannot attain."
Kendrick Lamar,rapper,"Lamar tries to carry a conceptual idea inside of his music, ""whether it's a big concept or it's so subtle you can't even tell until you get to 20 listens."" Fans and publications have theorized that his albums are related to different forms of mass media. Section.80 is regarded as a short story collection inspired and themed around events that impacted the millennial generation, such as Ronald Reagan's presidency. The nonlinear narrative structure of Good Kid, M.A.A.D City is billed as a coming-of-age short film that chronicles Lamar's harsh teenage experiences in his native Compton. Its cinematic scope has been compared to the screenplays written by filmmakers Martin Scorsese and Quentin Tarantino. To Pimp a Butterfly unfolds as both a poem and blank letter that explores the responsibilities of being a role model and documents life as an African American during Barack Obama's presidency. Damn is labeled as an introspective satire that explores the dualities of human nature and morality. Mr. Morale & the Big Steppers takes on the form of a theatrical play, with confessional lyrics based on Lamar's experiences in therapy."
Kendrick Lamar,rapper,== Legacy ==
Kendrick Lamar,rapper,"Insider Inc. and CNN editors have opined that Lamar is one of the most influential musicians of the 2010s decade, deeming him a paradigm shift in contemporary hip hop and popular culture. Throughout the Black Lives Matter movement and events following the 2016 U.S. presidential election, his work has been used as protest anthems. According to American studies and media scholar William Hoynes, Lamar's progressive elements places him amongst other African American artists and activists who ""worked both inside and outside of the mainstream to advance a counterculture that opposes the racist stereotypes being propagated in white-owned media and culture."" Matt Miller of Esquire opined that in recent years Lamar revived music videos as a form of social commentary."
Kendrick Lamar,rapper,"Lamar's music has consistently garnered critical acclaim as well as support from artists who have paved the way for his advancement. His Pulitzer Prize win was considered a sign of the American cultural elite formally recognizing hip hop as a ""legitimate artistic medium"". Senior artists such as Nas, Bruce Springsteen, Eminem, Dr. Dre, Prince, and Madonna have praised his musicianship. David Bowie's final album, Blackstar (2016), was inspired by To Pimp a Butterfly, and its producer Tony Visconti praised Lamar as a ""rulebreaker"" in the music industry. Pharrell Williams called him ""one of the greatest writers of our times"" and likened him to Bob Dylan. Lamar has also been cited as a strong influence on the works of various modern artists, including BTS, Dua Lipa, Tyler, the Creator, Roddy Ricch, and Rosalía. Lorde regards him as ""the most popular and influential artist in modern music."""
Kendrick Lamar,rapper,== Public image ==
Kendrick Lamar,rapper,"Lamar maintains a low public profile, and is known to be reserved. He is reluctant to publicly discuss his personal life and generally avoids using social media. He is also decisive when engaging with mainstream media outlets, although journalists have complimented his ""Zen-like"" calmness and down to earth personality. According to Lamar, he has become ""so invested in who I am outside of being famous, sometimes that's all I know. I've always been a person that really didn't dive too headfirst into wanting and needing attention. I mean, we all love attention, but for me, I don't necessarily adore it."" His lyrics have been a topic of media scrutiny, leading to both praise and controversy."
Kendrick Lamar,rapper,"Lamar's public perception has also been influenced by the various rap feuds he has been involved with. Although some journalists declared him the winner of his highly publicized conflict with Drake, some felt that his victory was pyrrhic due to the severity of accusations introduced and the spread of online misinformation. Following the release of Good Kid, M.A.A.D City, media outlets have described Lamar as the ""modern hip hop messiah"". Some critics dislike his ""grating"" political infusions, causing him to be viewed as having a savior complex. However, Lamar has declared himself to be the ""greatest rapper alive"" due to his personal connection to hip hop. ""I'm not doing it to have a good song, or one good rap, or a good hook, or a good bridge,"" he explained to Zane Lowe. ""I want to keep doing it every time, period. And to do it every time, you have to challenge yourself and you have to confirm to yourself—not anybody else, confirm to yourself that you're the best, period. [...] That's my drive and that's my hunger, I will always have."""
Kendrick Lamar,rapper,== Other ventures ==
Kendrick Lamar,rapper,=== Entrepreneurship ===
Kendrick Lamar,rapper,"Lamar has been described as an ""authentic"" businessman who takes ""calculated steps to establish his brand from the ground-up"" and leaves nothing to chance. He approaches traditional album rollouts with an unorthodox method, using Easter eggs and leaving cryptic messages. Before releasing a studio album, Lamar shares a promotional single taken from ""The Heart"", a timestamp song series designed to ""observe the beating pulse behind his music."" The vulnerable themes explored on the non-album singles have strengthened his relationship with his ""inquisitive"" fanbase known as Kenfolk. His real estate portfolio includes properties in California and New York. In 2011, Lamar crafted an original song with record producer Nosaj Thing to promote Microsoft's Windows Phone in 2011. He starred alongside DJ Calvin Harris and singer Ellie Goulding in a marketing campaign for Bacardi in 2014."
Kendrick Lamar,rapper,"As a minority shareholder of TDE, Lamar was set to serve as the executive producer for the label's film division. He partnered with American Express on advertising campaigns for Art Basel and Small Business Saturday, and is an angel investor of the music creation platform EngineEars. Lamar has also partnered with several fashion designers and outlets. As a brand ambassador, he was involved with designing sneakers for Reebok and Nike, Inc.

Through PGLang, he composed the score and co-designed the stage for Chanel's Spring/Summer 2024 haute couture collection."
Kendrick Lamar,rapper,=== Philanthropy and activism ===
Kendrick Lamar,rapper,"A supporter of the Black Lives Matter movement, Lamar is a vocal advocate for racial equality. In 2012, he commended Frank Ocean for coming out.

Regarded as the ""Queen of Rap"" and one of the most influential rappers of all time, she is noted for her dynamic rap flow, witty lyrics, musical versatility, and alter egos, and is credited as a driving force in the mainstream resurgence of female rap in the early 2010s. Minaj began rapping professionally in the early 2000s and gained recognition with her three mixtapes between 2007 and 2009."
Nicki Minaj,rapper,"Her debut studio album, Pink Friday (2010), topped the US Billboard 200 and achieved the largest female rap album sales week of the 21st century. Its top-five single ""Super Bass"" received a diamond certification from the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA). Minaj explored dance-pop on her second US number-one album, Pink Friday: Roman Reloaded (2012), which produced the diamond-certified single ""Starships"". She returned to her hip hop roots with her third and fourth albums, The Pinkprint (2014) and Queen (2018), which yielded the hit singles ""Anaconda"" and ""Chun-Li"". Minaj achieved her first two Billboard Hot 100 number-one singles in 2020 as a featured artist on Doja Cat's ""Say So"" and 6ix9ine's ""Trollz""; the former was the first female rap collaboration to top the chart. In 2022, she garnered her first solo US number-one song with ""Super Freaky Girl"", the first single from her fifth studio album, Pink Friday 2 (2023), which debuted at number one in the US and broke several female rap sales and streaming records. Its concert tour became the fourth-highest grossing tour for a rapper and highest-grossing tour for a female rapper in history."

Outside of music, her other endeavors include a fragrance line, a press on nails line, a Loci sneakers collection, and the radio show Queen Radio (2018–2023).

On television, she served as a judge on the twelfth season of American Idol (2013)."
Nicki Minaj,rapper,== Early life ==
Nicki Minaj,rapper,"Onika Tanya Maraj was born on December 8, 1982, in the Saint James district of Port of Spain, Trinidad and Tobago. Her father was Robert Maraj (1956–2021), a financial executive and part-time gospel singer of Dougla (Afro-Trinidadian mother and Indo-Trinidadian father) descent. Her mother, Carol, is also a gospel singer with Afro-Trinidadian ancestry. Carol worked in payroll and accounting departments during Minaj's youth. Minaj's father was an alcoholic and crack cocaine addict whom Minaj described to be ""violent"" and abusive to her mother. He committed arson onto their house in December 1987. She has an older brother named Jelani, a younger brother named Micaiah, and a younger sister named Ming."
Nicki Minaj,rapper,"As a child, Minaj and Jelani grew up with their grandmother in Saint James in a household with 11 cousins. Carol was working numerous jobs in Saint James before getting her green card at the age of 24. She then moved to the Bronx in New York to attend Monroe College, leaving both Minaj and Jelani in Trinidad with their grandmother. When Minaj was five, Carol brought Minaj and Jelani to live with her and their father in South Jamaica, Queens. Minaj said she arrived in the United States as an illegal immigrant, and by the time she moved to the country, her mother and father had lawful permanent residency. She stated in 2024 that she is not a US citizen. Minaj recalled, ""I don't think I had a lot of discipline in my household. My mom motivated me, but it wasn't a strict household. I kind of wanted a strict household.""  "
Nicki Minaj,rapper,"Minaj successfully auditioned for admission to Fiorello H. LaGuardia High School of Music & Art and Performing Arts, which focuses on visual and performing arts. A week after graduation, Minaj was cast in the Off-Broadway play In Case You Forget in 2001. At the age of 19, she worked as a waitress at a Red Lobster in the Bronx, but was fired for discourtesy to customers. She said she was fired from ""at least 15 jobs"" for similar reasons. Her other jobs included customer service representative and office management on Wall Street."
Nicki Minaj,rapper,== Career ==
Nicki Minaj,rapper,=== 2002–2009: Career beginnings and mixtapes ===
Nicki Minaj,rapper,"From 2002 to 2004, Minaj rapped in a New York hip hop group called Hoodstars, which included rappers Lou$tar and 7even Up and hype man Safaree Samuels. The son of Bowlegged Lou from Full Force, Lou$tar recruited Minaj when he and his father heard her work. Bowlegged Lou liked Minaj's rapping, and said that back then she was already doing ""the crazy voices"" in her vocal performances. In 2004, the group recorded the entrance song for WWE Diva Victoria, ""Don't Mess With"", which was featured on the compilation album ThemeAddict: WWE The Music, Vol.6. Full Force tried to get Hoodstars a record deal but were unsuccessful. They then worked with Minaj as a solo artist, meeting with some record companies, including Warner Brothers, who expressed interest in signing Minaj out of the group but required a ghostwriter for a deal. Minaj refused, adamant that she will always write her songs. Brian George from Full Force said that Minaj was impressive in her ambition, describing her as ""broke and hungry"" while determined to be in control of her craft. "
Nicki Minaj,rapper,"Minaj continued to work independently and uploaded her songs on her Myspace profile, sending several of them to people in the music industry. In 2006, Fendi, who owned the Brooklyn production company Dirty Money Entertainment, reached out to Minaj on Myspace, and signed her to Dirty Money under a 180-day contract. Originally using the stage name Nicki Maraj, she eventually changed it to Nicki Minaj after Fendi switched her last name when he met her due to her having a ""nasty flow"". Minaj wrote a number of songs, including ""Itty Bitty Piggy"" and ""I Get Crazy"", and booked shows in New York and New Jersey. She released her first mixtape, Playtime Is Over, on July 5, 2007. She filmed a music video for the track ""Click Clack"", which was featured on the underground rap DVD The Come Up Vol. 11. Her rap on the DVD caught the attention of rapper Lil Wayne, who got in contact with Fendi to set up a call with Minaj and asked her to join his crew he was assembling for his new imprint called Young Money. Minaj collaborated with Wayne, who featured on her next mixtapes, but she did not sign a contract with Young Money then. She continued working on her songs, communicating with fans on social media, and booking shows. "
Nicki Minaj,rapper,"Minaj released her second mixtape, Sucka Free, on April 12, 2008, and her third, Beam Me Up Scotty, on April 18, 2009; it received favorable coverage. The Beam Me Up Scotty track ""I Get Crazy"", reached number 20 on the U.S. Billboard Hot Rap Songs chart and number 37 on the Hot R&B/Hip-Hop Songs chart. In the summer of 2009, Minaj performed on a tour headlined by Wayne featuring artists from Young Money, among others. At the time, she was managed by Debra Antney. Minaj's mixtapes, freestyles, and features on other artists' songs garnered significant industry and public interest. While she continued playing shows, working on music, and collaborating with other artists, there was a bidding war among record labels to sign her. In late August, Minaj signed a recording contract with Young Money, with her deal entailing her owning her 360 rights, including her merchandising, sponsorships, endorsements, touring and publishing. In a 2011 interview, Minaj said that before she met Lil Wayne, ""the person that was spearheading my career was the one person who always told me, 'Don’t be too playful, don't be too kooky and weird... no one's gonna feel that, nobody wants to hear that.' So I stifled a lot of that early on, and then once that we parted ways, I was like, 'Guess what, I’m gonna just be me.'"" In October 2009, she performed a freestyle at the 2009 BET Hip Hop Awards cypher. The following month, she appeared with Gucci Mane and Trina on the remix of ""5 Star Bitch"" by Yo Gotti."
Nicki Minaj,rapper,"In early February 2010, Minaj made her first two appearances on the U.S. Billboard Hot 100 chart with her features on ""Knockout"" and ""Up Out My Face"" by Lil Wayne and Mariah Carey respectively. Minaj also appeared on ""BedRock"" and ""Roger That"" on the compilation album, We Are Young Money (2009). The singles peaked at numbers two and 56, respectively, in the U.S. Their parent album reached number nine on the U.S. Billboard 200, and was certified platinum by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA). At Jay-Z's suggestion, Robin Thicke featured Minaj on his single ""Shakin' It 4 Daddy"". Allison Stewart of The Washington Post stated that, during that time, she ""became the go-to girl for artists who wanted to add some skank to their tracks without sullying themselves in the process"". Minaj became the first female solo artist to have seven singles simultaneously charting in the U.S."
Nicki Minaj,rapper,=== 2010–2011: Breakthrough with Pink Friday ===
Nicki Minaj,rapper,"On March 29, 2010, Minaj released ""Massive Attack"" featuring Sean Garrett. Intended as the lead single from her forthcoming debut album, Pink Friday, the song was dropped from the album due to poor commercial performance. The next single, ""Your Love"", later became the album's lead single. Released in June, it peaked at number 14 on the U.S. Billboard Hot 100 and number one on the Rap Songs chart. The rapper was then featured on Christina Aguilera's song ""Woohoo"", which reached number 46 on the Canadian Hot 100 and number 79 on Billboard Hot 100. In September, Minaj released ""Check It Out"" with will.i.am and ""Right Thru Me"" as follow-up singles."
Nicki Minaj,rapper,"In October, Minaj was featured on Kanye West's ""Monster"", a posse cut with Jay-Z and Rick Ross featuring vocals from Justin Vernon of Bon Iver. Her verse received widespread acclaim with many critics regarding it as the best verse on that song. Complex rated Minaj's ""Monster"" verse as the number-one best rap verse in the past five years, while Sean Fennessey of The Village Voice stated that ""Monster"" was ""the track that announced Minaj's ""brilliance"" to most people."" Shortly after, she performed ""Monster"" with West and Jay-Z at Yankee Stadium, becoming the first ever female rapper to perform there. In November 2010, Minaj received her first Grammy Award nomination for her guest verse on Ludacris' song ""My Chick Bad""."
Nicki Minaj,rapper,"Pink Friday was released on November 19, 2010, debuting at number two and later reaching number one on the Billboard 200, with first-week sales of 375,000 copies. It had the largest sales week for a female rap album in the 21st century and second-highest sales week overall after Lauryn Hill's The Miseducation of Lauryn Hill (1998). The album also became the female rap album with the most weeks in the top ten on the Billboard 200 chart at the time, with fourteen consecutive weeks in the region. Upon release, the album received generally positive reviews from critics. The song ""Roman's Revenge"", featuring Eminem, was interpreted as a response to rapper Lil' Kim's comments against Minaj, including her accusing Minaj of copying her image and that she had recorded a song called ""Everywhere We Go"" with Minaj but it was pulled from iTunes by Cash Money because it did not perform well. At the time, Minaj said that ""Roman's Revenge"" was not about a specific person, but about ""everyone who has been in interviews talking"", adding, ""I’ve been quiet for such a long time and I’ve been the nice guy. I’ve been the person that gave everyone their props ... you can’t be a rapper and not speak on things being said about you"". In a 2018 interview, she explained that she wrote the song after ""a veteran got at me, and I hit them with 'Roman's Revenge' and then I kept on going."""
Nicki Minaj,rapper,"Pink Friday was certified platinum by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA) in December 2010, for moving a million units in the United States, with it becoming the first album by a solo female rapper to go platinum in seven years. As of March 2016, it has been certified triple-platinum. In 2022, the album was included in Rolling Stone's list of ""200 Greatest Hip-Hop Albums of All Time"" at number 31; the magazine stated that Pink Friday ""proved you could own the charts without dialing back your confrontational individuality, and it set the table for a generation of artists."" In 2024, Vibe named it as one of the ""50 Greatest Black Albums of the Modern Era"". ""Moment 4 Life"" featuring Drake was released as the fourth single from Pink Friday, on December 7, 2010. It reached number 13 on the Hot 100. Minaj performed ""Right Thru Me"" and ""Moment 4 Life"" as the musical guest on the January 29, 2011, episode of Saturday Night Live. In February 2011, Lil' Kim released the mixtape Black Friday referencing Minaj, including artwork that showed Lil' Kim decapitating Minaj with a sword and the lyrics ""sweetie, you goin' on your 14th minute of fame"" and ""you a Lil' Kim wannabe"". Lil' Kim sold the mixtape on PayPal. Minaj's track ""Tragedy"" was released online, featuring the lyrics ""Pink Friday, Eminem, 8 Mile/ It must hurt to sell your album on PayPal."""
Nicki Minaj,rapper,"""Super Bass"" was released as Pink Friday's fifth single in April 2011. It became a sleeper hit and commercially successful, ultimately peaking at number three on the Hot 100. It was eventually certified 12-times platinum in the US, for selling 12 million units; it became the highest-certified song by a female rapper in RIAA history. ""Super Bass"" was the highest-charting solo single by a female rapper, at the time, since Missy Elliott's ""Work It"" in 2002. In 2017, Billboard ranked it as the second-biggest US Hot 100 hit by a female rapper of all time (behind Iggy Azalea's ""Fancy""); and in 2024, ranked it as the biggest Hot 100 hit of Minaj's career. Its music video has over 1 billion views on YouTube, as of October 2024."
Nicki Minaj,rapper,"Minaj was one of the opening acts on Britney Spears' 2011 Femme Fatale Tour. She and Kesha appeared on the remix of Spears' ""Till the World Ends"", which peaked at number three in the U.S. On August 7, 2011, Minaj experienced a wardrobe malfunction during a live performance on Good Morning America when she revealed her left nipple. Both ABC and Minaj apologized for the incident, with Minaj denying it was a publicity stunt. Minaj continued to perform at high-profile events throughout 2011 with Donatella Versace inviting her to perform with Prince for the introduction of a Versace collection for H&M. She also performed ""Super Bass"" at the 2011 Victoria's Secret Fashion Show. In December 2011, Minaj was nominated for three Grammy Awards, including Best New Artist and Best Rap Album for Pink Friday. Also that year, she won the MTV Video Music Award for Best Hip-Hop Video for ""Super Bass"", marking her first VMA win."
Nicki Minaj,rapper,=== 2012–2013: Pink Friday: Roman Reloaded and American Idol ===
Nicki Minaj,rapper,"""Starships"" was released in February 2012 as the lead single from Minaj's forthcoming second album, Pink Friday: Roman Reloaded. The song reached number five on the US Billboard Hot 100, was the fifth best-selling single of 2012, and was certified diamond by the RIAA in November 2024, for moving over ten million units in the US. Her crossover into pop music was criticized by some, despite her commercial success. Follow-up singles ""Beez in the Trap"" featuring 2 Chainz and ""Right by My Side"" featuring Chris Brown were released shortly after."
Nicki Minaj,rapper,"Pink Friday: Roman Reloaded was eventually released on April 2, 2012, two months later than initially planned. It was preceded by the promotional singles ""Roman in Moscow"" and ""Stupid Hoe"". The latter song was viewed by critics as a diss aimed at Lil' Kim, following her previous attacks on Minaj. The album debuted at number one on the Billboard 200, with first-week sales of 253,000 copies, and was certified four-times platinum by the RIAA in November 2024, becoming Minaj's highest-certified album yet. However, the mix of hip-hop songs and mainstream pop material received mixed reviews. ""Pound the Alarm"" and ""Va Va Voom"" were later released as the final singles from the album. Minaj along with fellow rapper M.I.A. joined Madonna to perform the single, ""Give Me All Your Luvin"" during the Super Bowl XLVI halftime show on February 6, 2012. Minaj was the first solo female rapper to perform at the Grammy Awards, performing ""Roman Holiday"" during the 2012 ceremony on February 12. Her exorcism-themed performance was controversial, with the American Catholic League and its president criticizing her performance."
Nicki Minaj,rapper,"Minaj began her headlining Pink Friday Tour on May 16, 2012, which was followed by the Pink Friday: Reloaded Tour beginning October 14, 2012. Although she was scheduled to headline the June 3 Hot 97 Summer Jam at MetLife Stadium in New Jersey, at the request of Lil Wayne she canceled her appearance the day of the show after Peter Rosenberg of the station dismissed her single ""Starships"" as ""not real hip-hop"". The following month, she voiced Steffie in the animated film Ice Age: Continental Drift (2012). Minaj won awards for Best Female Video (for ""Starships"") at the 2012 MTV Video Music Awards and Best Hip-Hop at the 2012 MTV Europe Music Awards."
Nicki Minaj,rapper,"An expanded version of Pink Friday: Roman Reloaded, subtitled The Re-Up, was released on November 19, 2012, with seven new songs. That month, she was the subject of a three-part E! documentary titled Nicki Minaj: My Truth. In September, Minaj joined the judges' panel for the twelfth season of American Idol with Mariah Carey, Keith Urban, and Randy Jackson. Throughout the show there were disagreements between Carey and Minaj, with both of them leaving the series at the end of the season. Pink Friday: Roman Reloaded was the best-selling rap album released in 2012 in the US. It was also the 25th-best-selling album globally in 2012, with over 1.4 million copies sold worldwide, according to the International Federation of the Phonographic Industry (IFPI). In 2013, Minaj became the most-charted female rapper on the Billboard Hot 100 at the time, with 44 entries, and tied Carey as seventh among female artists."
Nicki Minaj,rapper,=== 2014–2017: The Pinkprint and acting ventures ===
Nicki Minaj,rapper,"Minaj's first live-action theatrical film The Other Woman was filmed in spring 2013 and premiered on April 25, 2014. As she was working on her third studio album The Pinkprint, she described the album as ""a continuation of The Re-Up with a lot more"" and said it would focus on her ""hip hop roots"". During an MTV interview, she said that she has ""much to talk about"" in the album."
Nicki Minaj,rapper,"""Pills n Potions"" was released as the lead single from The Pinkprint in May 2014. In July, she appeared on the song ""Bang Bang"" with singers Jessie J and Ariana Grande, which peaked at number three on the US Billboard Hot 100 and marked Minaj's first number-one on the UK singles chart. ""Bang Bang"" was certified diamond by the RIAA in May 2024, for recognized sales of 10 million units; it became the first all-female collaboration to achieve the certification. Its music video garnered over two billion views on YouTube. ""Anaconda"" was released in August as the second single from the album, peaking at number two, which became her highest-charting single in the US at the time. Its ascent from number 39 to number two in its third week marked the second-biggest jump within the chart's top 40 region, at the time. The music video for ""Anaconda"" went viral upon release online; it set a 24-hour Vevo record, accumulating 19.6 million views on its first day of release, breaking the record previously held by Miley Cyrus's ""Wrecking Ball"".

At the 2015 BET Awards, Minaj won her sixth consecutive award for Best Female Hip-Hop Artist, becoming the female rapper with most wins in that category. In August 2015, Madame Tussauds unveiled a wax figure of Minaj, which depicted a pose from the ""Anaconda"" music video. Minaj voiced her approval of the wax figure on social media. The wax figure received criticism from some, including Angharad Welsh of The Independent, who called it ""a sexist, racist mistake"". "
Nicki Minaj,rapper,"In May 2015, it was announced that Minaj would feature in the third installment of the Barbershop film series, alongside Ice Cube, Cedric the Entertainer, Eve, and other original cast members. Titled Barbershop: The Next Cut, the film was released on April 15, 2016.

Nicki Minaj,rapper,"In February 2017, Minaj featured on Gucci Mane's song ""Make Love"" and Jason Derulo's single ""Swalla"" alongside Ty Dolla Sign, the latter of which reached the top ten in several countries, including a peak of number six in the UK. Rapper Remy Ma released the diss track ""Shether"", which, among other claims and insults, alleged that Minaj used a ghostwriter and was in a 360-record deal. The track's release followed interviews where Remy Ma had praised Minaj, rapped over a couple of Minaj's songs, and released tracks that media interpreted as digs at Minaj. Remy Ma also released a second diss track aimed at Minaj, ""Another One"". Minaj responded in her single ""No Frauds"", featuring Drake and Lil Wayne, in which, among other digs, she took shots at Remy Ma's prison stint for assault, called her a ""fraud committin' perjury"", and accused her of using a ghostwriter, referring to her husband, rapper Papoose; Minaj also rapped ""I never signed a 360, bitch you wild dumb"". On her Instagram post promoting the song, Minaj wrote: ""Great diss records can’t be lies. Great diss records are FACTS ... Been writing my own raps since I was 11."" ""No Frauds"" was one of three songs Minaj released simultaneously, along with ""Changed It"" and ""Regret in Your Tears"". On March 20, 2017, with the three songs she released, Minaj broke the record for the most Billboard Hot 100 entries for a female artist, which at the time was previously held by Aretha Franklin.

Nicki Minaj,rapper,== Artistry ==
Nicki Minaj,rapper,=== Musical style and lyrics ===
Nicki Minaj,rapper,"Minaj is known for her animated rap flow, witty lyrics, and musical versatility. Her rapping is distinctive for its varying cadence and speed, and use of alter egos and accents, including British cockney. Minaj said in 2010: ""I want to be a balanced artist ... this is all years of me learning me and my style, and deciding to do something different that would get everyone's attention."" Her background in performing arts contributed to her vocal approach and overall artistry. She said that rapping is both an art and a sport to her, she enjoys changing up her rap flow, and sometimes spends hours revising her work. ""I love that people never know what Nicki they are going to get on a particular song. I like bringing out a different side."""
Nicki Minaj,rapper,"Minaj has made use of metaphors, punch lines, and word play. She often incorporates personas, using different accents or cadences. Marc Hogan of Spin said that through her character Roman, Minaj ""tap[ped] into the fire-breathing, giddily nihilistic spirit that drew so many rap heads to her mixtapes ... as well as her guest appearances on others' tracks. Jon Caramanica of The New York Times called Minaj a ""nimble, evocative rapper"" and ""intricate lyricist"" with a ""gift for comic accents and unexpected turns of phrase. She's a walking exaggeration, outsize in sound, personality and look. And she's a rapid evolver, discarding old modes as easily as adopting new ones."" PopMatters' Nick Soulsby called her lyrics and delivery ""a firework display of sharp metaphors, humorous comebacks and putdowns, a rainbow of emotion backed up by a talent for wordplay"", adding that ""while many rappers lean into a single style from start-to-end of a song — or even a career — Minaj is alive to the potential of her performances and challenges herself on the mic"". Writing for Paper magazine, Liza Dye said that Minaj's first mixtape ""established her lyrical talent and knack for creating a colorful world filled with witty rap references, vocal impressions and memorable characters."" The New York Times' Roxane Gay characterized Minaj's work by ""urgent lyrics, spitting in a range of voices and accents"", containing ""wit and sly humor"", and her raps ranging ""from bold and aggressive, to coquettish, to wanton and sultry, with a soupçon of women’s empowerment"", while her pace ""is often breathless but her diction is impeccable."""
Nicki Minaj,rapper,"AllMusic described her artistry as a ""unique combination of ferocity and humor, and a rap style built on razor-sharp wordplay, mercilessly blunt lyricism, and delivery that turns on a dime from sugary to snarling"". Evening Standard's Jochan Embley wrote that her lyrics ""stare gender and race in the eye"", and are ""fierce, hilarious, bombastic and deadly serious, often all bundled together in one. If she's not taking aim at other rappers ... she's promoting body confidence or providing a commentary on social issues."" Complex said that Minaj has written bars that are ""as insulting as they [are] clever"", and praised her versatility as a rapper ""with varied flows, ranging from sing-song to pummeling, and lines as personal as they [are] provocative"", noting that ""she could go as pop as she wants, but for Minaj, it all returns to rap."" Tara Colley of The Conversation described Minaj as a ""pre-eminent female rapper"", writing that she ""consistently straddled the distinct personas of gangsta boss and sexy pop siren without truly committing to either"" and her ""chameleonic ability"" yields debate on which version of Minaj rap fans prefer. Writing for Esquire, Terron Moore said that one of Minaj's traits as an artist is her ""fearlessness"", a staple of ""Nicki the Lyricist, the venomous, schizophrenic man eater who out-pens her male competitors, and her trail of guest verses"". Robby Seabrook III of XXL included Minaj in a list of ""most unique flows from rappers over the last five years"", writing that she ""has solidified her spot as a leader of the pack for her animated flows, inspiring many other women in hip-hop to play with their vocals. She goes from campy to bellicose, excited to eccentric, oftentimes all on one song."""
Nicki Minaj,rapper,"As a hip hop artist, Minaj's discography comprises various styles and sounds fused with hip hop, R&B, and pop. Several of her albums have been described as genre-blending. Minaj occasionally lends herself to electronic music genres, with Pink Friday marking her exploration of the genre, spawning the electropop-laden ""Super Bass"". Also combining hip hop with electronic music, Minaj's second album, Pink Friday Roman Reloaded, has several electro-rap and electro pop songs including ""Roman Holiday"", ""Beez in the Trap"", and ""Starships"". Zoe Johnson of XXL, stated in 2021 that in recent years Minaj's ""beat selection has moved to refined production full of grit and hip-hop flare"". Her fifth album Pink Friday 2 incorporates drill, pop, dancehall, afrobeats, R&B, Jersey club, and trap."
Nicki Minaj,rapper,=== Alter egos ===
Nicki Minaj,rapper,"With her parents frequently fighting during her childhood, Minaj lived through characters she created as a means of escape. She recalled that ""fantasy was my reality"" and her first identity was Cookie. She then moved on to Harajuku Barbie and, later, Nicki Minaj. In November 2010, Minaj assumed the alter ego Nicki Teresa, wearing a colorful headdress and calling herself ""healer to her fans"" during a visit to the Garden of Dreams Foundation at Fuse Studios in New York. She introduced another alter ego, Rosa (pronounced with an exaggerated R), to commemorate her December 2010 appearance on Lopez Tonight."

She's amazingly talented and I've been wearing her clothes forever."" Minaj also expressed appreciation for Cyndi Lauper's style and how her videos inspired her as a teenager: ""When I first went to get my hair colored, I was about 14 and I wanted blonde highlights. ...

Minaj was ranked as the tenth-greatest rapper and greatest female rapper of all time on Billboard and Vibe's list of the 50 greatest rappers (2023). In 2024, Billboard stated that while ""hip-hop has continued to cycle through rappers looking to knock Minaj off the throne"", she ""remains at the apex of the rap mountain 15 years after the release of her breakout mixtape, Beam Me Up Scotty"". The Source described Minaj as ""one of the most influential figures in the global music scene"", noting that she ""has consistently redefined US rap/hip-hop since her debut album Pink Friday""."
Nicki Minaj,rapper,"Minaj's work and career has been deemed groundbreaking by multiple publications. In Evening Standard, Jochan Embley named her one of the most influential rap artists of all time, writing that she ""repeatedly [broke] down barriers for female artists in the scene"" and ""everything she does is bold, fearless and distinct – whether that be her eye-popping stage attire or her expertly delivered lyrics"". Sowmya Krishnamurthy of NPR Music said that ""in a genre where men dominate the uppermost echelon"", Minaj ""indelibly changed the landscape for artists in hip-hop for the past decade, showing a complex visage: the ferocious emcee who's just as comfortable being the girl-next-door, glammed-up Barbie doll or rambunctious alter-ego Roman"". In 2020, Nick Soulsby of PopMatters called her the ""best female rapper and the best rapper of the past ten years – no gender preposition required."" Billboard said she ""redefined success for women in hip-hop"" in the decade. MTV Latin America named her as one of ""The Most Influential Women in the History of Music"", being the only rapper on the list. In 2024, Billboard ranked Minaj at number 13 on its ""Greatest Pop Stars of the 21st Century"" list, with Kyle Denis writing she ""isn't just the greatest female rapper [...] she's also one of the key architects of how pop music sounds, how pop fandom functions and how pop stars are perceived both online and in real life"". Her success as a female rapper ""has been a landmark step towards gender equality in the rap industry"", Bustle remarked. Nylon writer Demicia Inman said her impact ""stands as one of the most successful rappers of the millennium"", while she ""was required not just to rap well beyond her male peers, but also to be likable. In rejecting respectability politics, [Minaj] in-turn fueled a landmark career"", during which she has ""battled misogyny and industry bias against black women to carve her own identity and sound"" and ""highlighted and helped shift double standards""."
Nicki Minaj,rapper,"The New York Times's Caramanica wrote that Minaj became ""a nimble, evocative rapper, an intricate lyricist, a thoughtful singer, a risky performer"", and ""invented new personae"". ""More than any other rapper in the mainstream, she pushed hard against expectations"", becoming ""her own watermark"". NPR's Erik Nielson said in 2014 that Minaj's ""success over the last decade has stood as an exception to the unwritten rule that women rappers no longer have a place among elite artists"". Complex stated that ""from her bold outfits to her multi-colored wigs, Minaj oozed confidence that inspired others who were watching closely"". Glamour included Minaj in its list of 104 women who defined 2010s pop culture. XXL's Zoe Johnson called her ""one of the most versatile MCs to bless a mic"", adding that she ""helped birth a new generation of rappers that mimic her style and revamp her legendary bars. She's even helped pave the way for a select group of producers looking to create Nicki Minaj-type beats with dope rappers in mind."" Writing for The New York Times, Roxane Gay said that Minaj ""broadened the definition of hip-hop, making it more joyful, energetic and robust"". In their 20th anniversary cover story, XXL stated: ""the lyrical giant has become one of the key figures in recent years to help bring the culture to new heights. [Minaj's] work has been outstanding, her contributions countless and the pinkprint she is leaving behind as she goes will be a new guide for many artists to follow."""
Nicki Minaj,rapper,"The Independent described Minaj's rise to superstardom as ""almost without precedent"". Billboard credited Minaj for bringing female rap back to the mainstream in the US, and ranked her as the top female rapper on its decade-end chart of the most successful artists of the 2010s. With over 300 features, the magazine called Minaj a ""rap and pop icon"", adding that ""she's been one of popular music's most reliable guest performers, notching dozens of chart hits as a supporting presence on other artists' singles"". Complex said Minaj was able ""take a simple song and turn it into a smash hit just because she's featured on it"". She ""made almost a second career"" out of her features, and is the female artist in hip hop who has done the most collaborations with lesser-known artists, Forbes stated. While ""opting to spend the time and energy to help many acts secure their big break"", Minaj also ""cemented her status as a superstar—one who can succeed with any type of track."" Minaj became the most successful female hip hop artist in history. Michael Saponara of Billboard wrote that she ""reaffirmed living legend status"" by ""hitting the road for the Pink Friday 2 World Tour""—which became the highest-grossing tour by a female rapper and one of the top five highest grossing hip hop tours in history—and proved herself as rap's ""centrifugal female force"". With the tour, Minaj ""etched her name in the annals of music history"", The Source noted, while she ""leaves behind a legacy of groundbreaking achievements and artistry""."

Nicki Minaj,rapper,"Minaj's verse on Kanye West's ""Monster"" was critically acclaimed, with many critics considering it the best verse in the song. It had a significant role in establishing Minaj as a ""top tier talent who dispelled gender distinctions in rap"", and was ""the first time the conversation was ever about a female out-classing her male contemporaries"", Pitchfork stated. The Los Angeles Times named Minaj's verse as one of the 50 greatest moments in hip hop history, writing: ""Minaj was already a multiplatinum headliner by the time she laid down her song-stealing verse on Kanye West's all-star romp ""Monster"" ... Minaj's performance, as much a defiant declaration of women's empowerment as a gloriously unhinged lyrical flex, ranks as one of the most memorable mic drops in rap history."" West said that at one point he considered removing her verse from the track, because he was worried it would outshine his own work: ""I knew people would say that was the best verse on the best Hip Hop album of all time or arguably top ten albums of all time. ... and people to this day would say to me 'My favorite thing was Nicki Minaj's verse'."""
Nicki Minaj,rapper,"Minaj has been praised by other hip hop artists over the years. Rick Ross said he was impressed seeing Minaj write her verse on ""Monster"" and deliver her performance, deeming it the moment he knew she was ""one of the greatest"". Kanye West considered Minaj ""the scariest artist in the game right now"". ""She has the most potential out of everyone to be the number-two rapper of all time, cause nobody’s gonna be bigger than Eminem"". 50 Cent called Minaj an ""alpha female"", adding that ""[she] happens to be a girl, but that n***a is tough"". RZA complimented her ""versatility of lyricism and approach"". Ice-T said that Minaj ""does her thing. She has her own way of doing it. She has an ill vocal delivery. She kind of reminds me of a female Busta Rhymes, like how she throws her voice in different directions."" Chance the Rapper highlighted Minaj's work ""beyond hip hop ... streaming rights, like the rights of us like to let us connect the money were owed, the rights of Billboard to start accounting streams that they weren't counting - that was Nicki Minaj. So I respect Nicki in a whole different way."""

She stated that she ""went so far to the other side that there's only one place to go from there. You can either continue doing costumes or you can just say, ""Hey guess what? This will shock them even more. Doing nothing will shock them even more""""."
Nicki Minaj,rapper,"Early in her career, she made autographing breasts part of her movement to empower women. In 2010, she said that although she originally felt obligated to mimic the provocative behavior of the ""female rappers of [her] day"", she intended to subdue her sexuality because she ""[wants] people—especially young girls—to know that in life, nothing is going to be based on sex appeal. You've got to have something else to go with that."" Her physique, notably her buttocks, attracted attention from the media. Minaj has been included on the annual Maxim Hot 100 list several times."
Nicki Minaj,rapper,"Minaj spoke about feminism in an interview with Vogue in 2015, saying ""There are things that I do that feminists don't like, and there are things that I do that they do like. I don't label myself. I just say the truth about what I feel. I feel like women can do anything that they put their minds to."" In a 2018 interview, she discussed sex workers, her own sex appeal, and sexuality in music and on social media, which attracted criticism. In The New York Times Magazine, music critic Vanessa Grigoriadis said that Minaj ""has become expert at modelling the ways that women can wield power in the industry. But she has also drawn attention to the ways in which power can be embodied by a woman standing up for herself and speaking her own mind."" The cover art and music video for her 2014 single, ""Anaconda"", attracted significant media attention upon release. The Guardian called the video ""racy"" but noted that she ""doesn't shy from ruffling her audience's feathers"", while others praised Minaj for ""owning her sexuality"", examining her work through a feminist perspective. Another writer for The Guardian said, of the ""Anaconda"" video, Minaj turns ""the classic song into a conversation, and [refuses] to let the camera objectify her lap dance by keeping it zoomed out, at a distance."""
Nicki Minaj,rapper,"Minaj's outspoken views, feuds with several rappers, personal life, and fanbase have received significant media attention. A portion of her fandom online have been reported to be combative to Minaj's critics, including incidents of reported doxxing, cyberbullying, and death threats from some fans. Minaj was a vocal proponent of streams counting towards an artist's sales and RIAA certifications. The organization announced in 2016 that it would be modernizing the certification process for albums, including on-demand audio and video streams."

These donations helped the village get a computer center, a tailoring institute, a reading program, and two water wells. ""This is the kind of thing that makes me feel the most proud"", she said about the new additions to the village."
Nicki Minaj,rapper,"In August 2017, after Hurricane Harvey hit the city of Houston, Texas, Minaj answered a social media challenge by comedian and actor Kevin Hart and donated $25,000 to the Red Cross, saying she was ""praying for everyone there"". On September 4, 2018, Minaj appeared as a guest and performed several songs on The Ellen DeGeneres Show. Throughout the episode, Minaj and Degeneres, with the participation of Walmart, gave out over $150,000 in donations to fans."
Nicki Minaj,rapper,"In 2019, Minaj pulled out of headlining a concert in Saudi Arabia following online backlash from activists, after women's rights activist Loujain al-Hathloul was detained and arrested for speaking out against the Saudi regime. Minaj was praised by Thor Halvorssen of The Human Rights Foundation, who criticized her initial plan to perform in a letter, and released a statement saying, ""After careful reflection ... I believe it is important for me to make clear my support for the rights of women, the LGBTQ community and freedom of expression."""
Nicki Minaj,rapper,"In 2020, Minaj donated $25,000 to the St. Jude's Home for Girls school after visiting the school in her native country of Trinidad. In a speech, Minaj encouraged the girls to push through hard obstacles, even referencing her own experience with domestic violence: ""I've experienced being in a home with domestic violence. I've experienced, you know, being at a very difficult crossroads in my life as a teenager. And sometimes as a teenager when things happen, you feel like there's no up from there."" In the same year, following the release of Minaj and 6ix9ine's collaboration, ""Trollz"", Minaj announced that a portion of the proceeds from the song, along with profits from all merchandise, will go towards the Bail Project amid the Black Lives Matter protests sparked by the murder of George Floyd.

When Minaj and her husband moved to California, he failed to update his residence on the sex offender registration and was indicted in February 2020; he registered in the state's database by the following month. In August 2021, Jennifer Hough, the woman who accused Petty when they were both 16, filed a lawsuit against the couple alleging harassment, intimidation and infliction of emotional distress, and requested a $20 million default judgement when Minaj did not respond to the lawsuit in time; the court declined it, declaring that Minaj was not in default. Minaj filed a response, calling the allegations ""blatant falsehoods"" and including evidence of discrepancies in Hough's story. Minaj stated that she ""never asked [Hough] to change her story"", ""never offered her any money in return for a statement"", and ""did not threaten her with any type of harm"". She stated that, after her husband's indictment, Hough contacted her via a mutual acquaintance, and in their phone call, indirectly asked Minaj for a payoff, ""mistakenly believ[ing] that I would pay her money to take back her accusation against my husband"". Minaj said she responded by telling Hough that ""the indictment was my husband's problem, not mine, and that he would have to live with the consequences of having chosen years ago to plead guilty to a crime which he did not commit"", and that Hough said ""I'm not saying it didn’t happen, but maybe it was just a misunderstanding"". Hough voluntarily dismissed the case against Minaj."

He claimed that in April 2024, while he was working as a day-to-day manager on her Pink Friday 2 tour, Minaj struck him multiple times after he had another employee collect her prescription in his place. He alleged that Minaj's former manager, Debra Antney, then informed him that he would not be joining the tour group for their next tour date.

After a brief contract with Motown Records, he was known as a songwriter and co-founder of the production team the Smeezingtons. Mars became known as a recording artist after guest performances on the singles ""Nothin' on You"" (2009) by B.o.B and ""Billionaire"" (2010) by Travie McCoy, which peaked at numbers one and four on the Billboard Hot 100.

Bruno Mars,singer,== Life and career ==
Bruno Mars,singer,=== 1985–2003: Early life and musical beginnings ===
Bruno Mars,singer,"Peter Gene Hernandez was born on October 8, 1985, in Honolulu, Hawaii, to Peter Hernandez and Bernadette San Pedro Bayot. He grew up in the Waikiki neighborhood of Honolulu. His father has Puerto Rican and Jewish heritage and is from Brooklyn, New York. Mars has said that his Jewish ancestors were from Hungary and Ukraine. His mother emigrated from the Philippines to Hawaii, and had Filipino and Spanish ancestry. Mars' parents met while performing in a show in which his mother was a hula dancer and his father was a percussionist. At age two, he was nicknamed ""Bruno"" by his father because of his resemblance to professional wrestler Bruno Sammartino."
Bruno Mars,singer,"Mars is one of six children and came from a musical family who exposed him to a diverse mix of musical genres, including rock and roll, reggae, hip hop, and rhythm and blues. His mother was a singer and a dancer and his father performed Little Richard's music, which inspired him as a young child. His uncle, an Elvis impersonator, encouraged the three-year-old Mars to perform songs by Presley and Michael Jackson. Mars began performing five days a week with his family's band (the Love Notes) at age four, and became known in Hawaii for his onstage impersonation of Elvis Presley. He urinated on himself during a performance of Presley's ""Can't Help Falling in Love"" when he was five; his parents though they might be making a mistake, but he never wavered. Mars appeared in the Hawaiian tabloid shopper MidWeek as ""Little Elvis"" in 1990, and performed in the halftime show of the 1990 Aloha Bowl."
Bruno Mars,singer,"He had a cameo role in the 1992 film Honeymoon in Vegas, and was interviewed by Pauly Shore on MTV. When Mars was six years old, he appeared on The Arsenio Hall Show. He performed two shows a night throughout grade school with his family's band, covering Frankie Lymon and Little Anthony songs. The young Mars had a small drum set, guitar, piano and percussion instruments, and learned to play them. His parents divorced when he was 12 (ending the Love Notes), and his father's varied businesses failed. Mars, his brother and father lived in the ""slums of Hawaii"" in a car, on rooftops, and in a closed bird zoo (Paradise Park) where his father had worked. Mars changed schools and was bullied, but later became popular."
Bruno Mars,singer,"His Elvis impersonations had a major impact on his musical evolution and performing technique. Mars began playing guitar, inspired by American rock guitarist Jimi Hendrix. In 2010, he acknowledged his Hawaiian roots and musical family as an influence: ""Growing up in Hawaii made me the man I am. I used to do a lot of shows in Hawaii with my father's band. Everybody in my family sings, everyone plays instruments ... I've just been surrounded by it."" At President Theodore Roosevelt High School in Honolulu, Mars sang in a group (the School Boys) who opened for his father's new band with songs by the Isley Brothers and the Temptations. He became well-known in Hawaiian entertainment in high school, opening for a large magic show and impersonating Michael Jackson for $75 per performance."
Bruno Mars,singer,"After his sister in Los Angeles played a demo for Mike Lynn (head of A&R at Dr. Dre's Aftermath Entertainment label), Lynn summoned Mars to Los Angeles. In 2003, shortly after graduating from high school, Mars pursued a musical career. He lived on Mansfield Avenue, and was surprised by its poverty and squalor. Mars adopted his stage name from his father's childhood nickname, adding ""Mars"" at the end: ""I felt like I didn't have no pizzazz, and a lot of girls say I'm out of this world, so I was like I guess I'm from Mars."" His stage name was also an effort to ""avoid being stereotyped"", since the music industry tried to pigeonhole him as another Latin artist and tried to convince him to sing in Spanish."
Bruno Mars,singer,=== 2004–2008: Career beginnings ===
Bruno Mars,singer,"Shortly after moving to Los Angeles, Mars signed a record contract with Motown Records in 2004, but the deal ""went nowhere"", leading him to have a conversation with will.i.am's management, which also turned out to be fruitless. However, the singer's experience with Motown proved to be beneficial to his career. American songwriter and record producer Philip Lawrence was also signed to the label. After Mars was dropped by the label less than a year after being signed, he stayed in Los Angeles and landed a music publishing deal in 2005 with American record producers Steve Lindsey and Cameron Strang at Westside Independent."
Bruno Mars,singer,"Lindsey showed Mars and fellow songwriters Brody Brown and Jeff Bhasker (who Mars met through Mike Lynn) the ins and outs of writing pop music and acted as a mentor, helping them to hone their craft. Bhasker explained that Lindsey would ""mentor us, and kind of give us lectures as to what a hit pop song is, because you can have talent and music ability, but understanding what makes a hit pop song is a whole other discipline."" Lindsey confessed he ""held Mars back for five years while they learned an extensive catalog of hit music."" In a different interview, Brown corroborated the former story. During this time, Mars played cover songs around Los Angeles in a band called Sex Panther, with Bhasker and Eric Hernandez (the former's brother), who eventually became the drummer of The Hooligans."
Bruno Mars,singer,"When Lawrence was first told he should meet Mars he was reluctant to do so since he did not even have money for bus fare. Keith Harris, the drummer for the American musical group The Black Eyed Peas, told Lawrence: ""Whatever it costs you to get out here, I'll reimburse you."" Lawrence responded: ""Just give me five dollars back for the bus."" The pair began collaborating, writing songs for Mars, but they received many rejections from record labels. In 2006, Lawrence introduced Mars to his future A&R manager at Atlantic Records, Aaron Bay-Schuck. After hearing him play a couple of songs on the guitar Bay-Schuck wanted to sign him immediately. However, it took roughly three years for Atlantic Records to finally sign Mars, because they felt it was too early and that he still needed to develop as an artist."
Bruno Mars,singer,=== 2008–2010: Production work and It's Better If You Don't Understand ===
Bruno Mars,singer,"In 2008, on the verge of giving up, they received a call from Brandon Creed, who was looking for songs for a reunited Menudo. He liked their song ""Lost"", which was written for Mars. The duo did not want to give the song away, but when they were offered $20,000 for it, they agreed. The sale of this song allowed them to continue working, and Mars and Lawrence decided that they would write and produce songs together for other artists. Eventually Creed became the former's manager for nine years."
Bruno Mars,singer,"Before becoming a successful solo artist, Mars was an acknowledged music producer, writing songs for Alexandra Burke, Adam Levine, Brandy, Sean Kingston, and K'naan. Mars stated that the first ""big hit"" he and Lawrence wrote was the 2009 single ""Right Round"" by Flo Rida: ""That was our first taste of what could really happen with a hit we hundred-percented"". He also co-wrote the Sugababes's ""Get Sexy"" (2009) and provided backing vocals on their album Sweet 7 (2010). In 2009, he was featured as a singer on Far East Movement's second studio album, Animal, on the track ""3D"". In the same year, he was also featured on American pastor and hip hop artist Jaeson Ma's debut single ""Love"" and on American rapper Travie McCoy's ""One at a Time"", a charity single for MTV's Staying Alive foundation. He reached prominence as a solo artist after being featured on, and composing (as part of the production group the Smeezingtons) American rapper B.o.B's ""Nothin' on You"" (2009) and McCoy's ""Billionaire"" (2010); both songs peaked within the top ten of various music charts, with the former charting at number one on both the United States Billboard Hot 100 and the UK Singles Chart."
Bruno Mars,singer,"Mars said of these successful singles: ""I think those songs weren't meant to be full-sung songs. If I'd sung all of 'Nothin' on You', it might've sounded like some '90s R&B."" On May 11, 2010, Mars released his debut extended play (EP), It's Better If You Don't Understand. It peaked at number 99 on the US Billboard 200 and a music video was released for the song ""The Other Side"" featuring American singer CeeLo Green and B.o.B. Mars, with the Smeezingtons, also composed Green's successful single ""Fuck You"" (2010)."
Bruno Mars,singer,=== 2010–2012: Doo-Wops and Hooligans ===
Bruno Mars,singer,"On July 20, 2010, Mars released ""Just the Way You Are"" as the lead single from his debut studio album, Doo-Wops & Hooligans (2010), an album produced mainly by the Smeezingtons. The song topped the charts in various countries, including Australia, Canada and the U.S. The album, released on October 5, 2010, debuted at number three on the Billboard 200 and number one in the UK. It also charted at number one in the Netherlands and Canada. Doo-Wops & Hooligans has since sold 15.5 million copies worldwide. It spawned two other singles, ""Grenade"", which topped the Billboard Hot 100, New Zealand, the UK, as well as multiple other charts, and ""The Lazy Song"", which peaked at number four on the Billboard Hot 100 and reached the top spot in the UK and Denmark."
Bruno Mars,singer,"Other singles include ""Talking to the Moon"", exclusively released in Brazil and topped Billboard Brasil's Hot Pop Songs and Hot 100 Airplay. ""Marry You"", only released to international markets, entering the top ten of various countries, and ""Count On Me"", which served as the final single in Australia. Mars released ""It Will Rain"" for The Twilight Saga: Breaking Dawn – Part 1 film soundtrack (2011). The single reached number three in the U.S. and number two in New Zealand.

The songs peaked at number four, sixteen, and seven in the U.S. and reached the top-20 of various countries."
Bruno Mars,singer,"Mars started to promote his debut album as the opening act for American bands Maroon 5 and OneRepublic on the fall leg of the former act's Palm Trees & Power Lines Tour. Later, on October 18, 2010, the singer began a co-headlined European concert tour with McCoy that lasted until early November. Doo-Wops & Hooligans received further promotion when the singer embarked on his first headlined concert tour, The Doo-Wops & Hooligans Tour, which ran from November 2010 to January 2012. Nevertheless, in February 2011, a joint co-headlining tour between Mars and Janelle Monáe was announced, dubbed Hooligans in Wondaland Tour (2011). The concert tour was performed in North America in May and June 2011. Mars turned down offers to open for notable artists on arena tours, opting instead to play at smaller venues such as theaters and ballrooms. This made the tour less lucrative, but helped him build his fan base."
Bruno Mars,singer,"At the 2011 Grammy Awards, Mars won his first Grammy Award for Best Male Pop Vocal Performance for ""Just the Way You Are"" and received other six nominations for his work: Best Rap Song, Best Rap/Sung Collaboration and Record of the Year for ""Nothin' on You""; the latter category along with Song of the Year for ""Fuck You"" by CeeLo Green, and Producer of the Year, Non-Classical as part of the Smeezingtons.

Bruno Mars,singer,=== Influences ===
Bruno Mars,singer,"Mars was raised on his father's 1950s doo-wop collection–""simple four-chord songs that got straight to the point""–and on Little Richard, Frankie Lymon, Little Anthony, and Jerry Lee Lewis. As a child, Mars spent time impersonating Elvis Presley. The playacting had a major impact on his musical evolution; he reflected: I'm a big fan of 1950s Elvis when he would go on stage and scare people because he was a force and girls would go nuts! You can say the same thing for Prince or The Police. It's just guys who know that people are here to see a show, so I watch those guys and I love studying them because I'm a fan. He also impersonated Michael Jackson, another major inspiration. The hip-hop productions by The Neptunes and Timbaland, that were played on the radio, also influenced him."
Bruno Mars,singer,"Mars's musical style gravitated initially towards R&B. He was influenced by artists such as Keith Sweat, Jodeci, and R. Kelly. As a child he also took notice of Jimmy Jam and Terry Lewis, New Edition, Bobby Brown, Boyz II Men, Teddy Riley, and Babyface. At the same time, he also listened to 1950s rock 'n' roll, doo-wop music, and Motown. In high school, he listened to classic rock groups such as Led Zeppelin, and The Beatles, whose influences can be heard in his work, as well as singers with high voices, like Stevie Wonder and Freddie Mercury. Bob Marley, and local bands in Hawaii, were a major influence and account for his reggae roots. Hip-hop acts like Jay-Z, The Roots, and Cody Chesnutt were among some of his favorites, and have influenced his compositions. Each of these musical genres has influenced the singer's musical style; he observed: ""It's not easy to [create] songs with that mixture of rock and soul and hip-hop, and there's only a handful of them."" Mars also admires classical music."
Bruno Mars,singer,"Other artists Mars has said inspired his work include Janet Jackson, Jimi Hendrix, Amy Winehouse, Sly Stone, Carlos Santana, George Clinton, and Usher. Mars has also stated that he is a fan of Alicia Keys, Jessie J, Jack White, The Saturdays, and Kings of Leon."
Bruno Mars,singer,=== Musical style and themes ===
Bruno Mars,singer,"Mars's music has been noted for displaying a wide variety of styles, musical genres, and influences, including pop, R&B, funk, soul, reggae, and rock. His debut album, Doo-Wops & Hooligans, is predominantly a pop, reggae pop and R&B record. It is influenced by most of the genres mentioned above. Many of his songs on the album, reflect ""feel-good"", carefree, and optimistic sentiments. However darker subjects are addressed in his songs, detailing failed relationships, pain and loneliness. His subsequent release, Unorthodox Jukebox, as with his debut album, is infused with different influences including disco, funk, rock, reggae and soul, as well as balladry. Lyrically, the album is different from the former, addressing traditional notions of romance, male chauvinism, and sexuality. The explicit content in the song ""Gorilla"" caused a controversy in Australia. Mars's third album, 24K Magic, was significantly influenced by R&B, funk, pop and new jack swing. Lyrically, the album involves themes of money and sex. An Evening with Silk Sonic is the debut studio album by American musical superduo Silk Sonic, composed of Mars and Anderson .Paak. The album is rooted in R&B, soul, funk, hip hop and pop music. It explores themes of ""seduction, romance"", reconciliation and materialism."

Jon Caramanica of The New York Times commented that he is one of the most ""versatile and accessible singers in pop, with a light, soul-influenced voice that's an easy fit in a range of styles, a universal donor"", while Tim Sendra from AllMusic described the singer's vocals on Doo-Wops & Hooligans as ""the kind of smooth instrument that slips into your ear like honey."" Jody Rosen from Rolling Stone called Mars a ""nimble, soulful vocalist"" on Unorthodox Jukebox. Jim Farber of the New York Daily News likened the voice ""the purity, cream and range of mid-period Michael Jackson"" in a review of a concert promoting Unorthodox Jukebox. On 24K Magic, Consequence of Sound's Karen Gwen affirmed that Mars showed his ""pips"" and pushed his vocals to the limit. She described his voice as a ""clear, unapologetic tenor"" being a ""blessing"" nowadays. Jon Caramanica of The New York Times found 24K Magic to show the singer's vocal ability from tenderness to ""the more forceful side of his voice""."
Bruno Mars,singer,=== Songwriting ===
Bruno Mars,singer,"Mars has explained his writing process: ""I don't sit down and think, 'I'm going to write a song'"", since ""You can't force creativeness"" as inspiration comes out of the blue in different places. Ideas occur suddenly to him; and occasionally, he is able to materialize them into lyrics. He has said that he typically writes songs by playing the guitar or piano first. Mars plays drums, guitar, keyboard, bass, piano, ukulele, and congas. He usually plays the instrumentation or part of it, on his albums and on the songs he composes for other artists."
Bruno Mars,singer,"Mars claims that his work with other artists has influenced his musical style: ""Nothin' on You had a Motown vibe, Billionaire was a reggae acoustic guitar-driven song, though one of my favorites is the CeeLo Green song. I don't think anyone else could've sung that song. And there's Just the Way You Are. If you know my story, you know I love all different genres of music."" Mars feels that growing up in Hawaii influenced his style, giving the songs a reggae sound. He explains: ""In Hawaii some of the biggest radio stations are reggae. That music brings people together. It's not urban music or pop music. It's just songs. That's what makes it cross over so well. The song comes first."""
Bruno Mars,singer,"Philip Lawrence, one of his music partners, stated: ""What people don't know is there's a darker underbelly to Bruno Mars."" Nevertheless, most of his music is romantic and Mars himself says: ""I blame that on me singing to girls back in high school"". Brody Brown, who has worked various times with Mars, affirmed that the latter is in charge of both the melody and lyrics of his tracks, ""I'll just do the music, but Bruno does both. I chime in on some things with words, but the majority of the content is written by Bruno and Phil (Lawrence)."""
Bruno Mars,singer,=== Showmanship ===
Bruno Mars,singer,"Mars is known for his retro showmanship, which is widely acclaimed by tour critics and reviewers. Deanna Ramsay of The Jakarta Post described Mars as a ""truly global star"". Boston Herald's Jim Sullivan compared the showmanship of Mars to Michael Jackson and Elvis Presley. Kevin Johnson of the St. Louis Post-Dispatch called Mars a ""consummate performer."" The Boston Globe's Sarah Rodman said that Mars shows an ""indefatigable ecstatic approach to performing"" and ""classic showmanship."" In the same vein, Jim Farber of the Daily News commented about the halftime show at Super Bowl XLVIII that Mars ""brings old-school showmanship to dynamic performance."" The singer took its inspiration by playing videotapes of Elvis, James Brown and Michael Jackson when he was younger. Now before shows he watches Brown's T.A.M.I. Show, James Hendrix's Live at Woodstock or Prince performing ""Purple Rain"" (1984)."
Bruno Mars,singer,"During The Doo-Wops & Hooligans Tour, Ara Jansan from The West Australian called the performance ""one of the most creative and exciting displays of musical artistry"" she had witnessed in a long time and noticed the concert attracted a wide-ranging audience of all age groups. The Oregonian's Robert Ham noticed, on the Hooligans in Wondaland Tour, that the singer not only grabbed the spectators' attention throughout the entire concert, but he also sang every note by himself with noticeable guitar skills. During the Moonshine Jungle Tour, Jason Lipshutz of Billboard described the singer's performance as ""entertaining ... keeping smiles plastered on the faces of his onlookers, and he does a better job at it than almost anyone working in music right now"". Rolling Stone magazine placed Mars at number 35 on its list of 50 Best Live Acts Right Now in 2013; ""Anyone from the age of 5 to 95 can walk out of a Bruno Mars concert feeling like the show was designed just for them. Mars walks the old-school walk and talks the sexy talk, but he also nails the hits, leads a super-energetic nine-piece soul band, and rips a mean drum solo"". NFL executives Sarah Moll and Tracy Perlman said, ""If you go to his concerts, it's 11-year-old girls to 65-year-old women—it's everyone"", after seeing The Moonshine Jungle tour several times during the summer of 2013. The 24K Magic World Tour, was praised by critics due to the showmanship, guitar skills and stage production. The tour won two Pollstar awards, two Billboard Music Awards and one TEC Award. Mars's concert residency at Bruno Mars at Park MGM, won Top R&B Tour at the 2022 Billboard Music Awards."
Bruno Mars,singer,"Mars's concerts feature The Hooligans, a band that includes a guitarist, bassist, drummer, keyboardist, and a horn section. They also serve as dancers and background singers. Critics noted the difference the backup band and the arrangements made to the sound of the live versions of the songs compared to those on the album. The shows feature all-band choreographed dancing arrangements, including footwork inspired by James Brown and the splits. The shows are influenced by the disco era with a soul revue-inspired set. In addition, long, mellow, and soft interludes that echo the smooth contemporary R&B style which was popular during the 1990s are also part of the show. The set lists blend several genres of music, including pop, doo-wop, funk, R&B, soul, and reggae. His shows usually feature pyrotechnics, strobe and laser lighting, and he typically plays the drums and guitar. In 2021, Pollstar named Mars the hip-hop/R&B touring artist of the 2010s decade."
Bruno Mars,singer,=== Music videos ===
Bruno Mars,singer,"Mars has collaborated with many different directors to produce his music videos, and over time he emerged as a music video director.

In 2011, not only Mars developed the second concept and treatment for ""The Lazy Song"", but he also brought in Duddy to co-directed the music video with him. In an interview, Duddy elaborated that he and Mars ""can fight like sisters when it comes to doing music videos. The best collaborations are always fueled by opposite perspectives or alternative ideas. We always find a common ground."" In 2018, Mars co-directed the music video for ""Finesse"" with Florent Dechard. He continued to collaborate with Dechard on the music videos for ""Please Me"", ""Blow"", ""Leave the Door Open"" and ""Skate""."

The aforementioned music video also won Best Editing at the 2021 MTV Video Music Awards."
Bruno Mars,singer,=== Aesthetic ===
Bruno Mars,singer,"Mars not only wears outfits inspired by previous decades, but he also matches that aesthetic to his music. On his debut studio album, Doo-Wops and Hooligans, the singer wore '60s-inspired suits and presented faded hair. However, on his third studio album, 24K Magic, Mars was channeling the '80s and '90s in its sound and aesthetic. During the recording process of 24K Magic, Mars imposed a dress code in the studio, favoring jewelry and ""fine clothes"" over sweatpants to create ""groovy, smooth and soulful songs"". In 2021, he collaborated with Anderson .Paak on their supergroup, Silk Sonic, to release their debut studio album, An Evening with Silk Sonic. Mars wore ""wide collars, leisure suits, and funky patterns"", as was usual in the 1970s, which was also paired with their sound. Tessa Petak writing for InStyle affirmed, ""Regardless of the decade he's emulating, Mars's fashion sense and stage presence make him larger-than-life""."

Bruno Mars,singer,== Impact ==
Bruno Mars,singer,"Bruno Mars has been declared a ""pop icon"" by media outlets such as The Philippine Star, Evansville Courier & Press, The Dickinson Press, and iHeartRadio. The Guardian writer Michael Cragg deemed ""the Bruno Mars strategy"" the career path of ""songwriter turned popstar"", as he became known within the music industry by writing and producing hit singles for other artists, and eventually appearing as a featured artist on them—with The New Yorker stating that he overshadowed the lead artists on those songs. Amanda Petrusich of The New Yorker described him as ""arguably one of the most instinctive and enthralling showmen of his generation"". Fuse TV credited Mars for bringing the ""funkalicious vibes of retro pop and R&B back to modern music"" in 2017, while The Independent writer Roisin O'connor later called him the ""king of retro crooning"". In 2013, NPR Music writer Ann Powers defined Mars as ""the most valuable pop historian"" at the time. In 2016, Damien Scott writing for BET called Mars ""the prince of pop music"". In 2019, Margaret Farrell from Stereogum affirmed that ""Uptown Funk""'s success solidified Mars's ""kingly pop stature""."
Bruno Mars,singer,"Billboard wrote in 2018 that no male artist in pop music during the 2010s has enjoyed a longer success streak than Mars. Similarly, Slate considered him ""the most consistent male pop star of the 2010s"". In 2021, WBLS stated that Mars ""has been a dominant force in popular culture for more than a decade"". In 2023, The Times ranked Mars as the thirteenth best vocalist of the 21st century among 20.

Speaking on his Puerto Rican roots and ethnic labels, Remezcla argued that Mars is ""the first proud Latino artist to make it"" to the ""top of international pop culture"" while not following the music industry's ""cynical labels game"" to be pigeonholed. His music and showmanship have inspired singers such as AJ Mitchell, Thomas Rhett, Dua Lipa, Benny Dayal, Rauw Alejandro, KiDi, Lee Brice, Shawn Mendes, Selena Gomez, and Meghan Trainor."
Bruno Mars,singer,"In 2013, Mars was named Artist of the Year by Billboard and in 2016 he became the recipient of NRJ Artist of Honor recognizing his contribution to music"".

Bruno Mars,singer,"Due to the ticket reselling that occurred during the week after the performance of Mars at the Super Bowl, and to limit that kind of profiteering, Hawaii Senate President Donna Mercado Kim introduced Senate Resolution 12, also known as the Bruno Mars Act. It limits all ticket purchases within 48 hours of the on-sale date to the physical box office so that anyone who comes to the box office to buy tickets for a show should almost be guaranteed a ticket and discourages ticket scalping. The State Senate in Hawaii passed the law. However, the bill died at the conference committee. As of September 2021, Billboard reported that Mars has earned $604.4 million from concerts. He is one of fewer than 30 artists to cross the $600 million threshold in Boxscore history."

That's what mom wants, she told me."""
Bruno Mars,singer,=== Race ===
Bruno Mars,singer,"In 2013, Mars told Rolling Stone that record executives ""had trouble categorizing him"", and were consequently unsure which radio stations would play his songs, or to which ethnic group (black or white) he would appeal. In the same month, he confessed that ""Nothin' on You"" was rejected by a ""music industry decision-maker"" because of his race. That experience made him feel like a ""mutant"", and he says that was his lowest point. ""Even with that song in my back pocket to seal the deal, things like that are coming out of people's mouths. It made me feel like I wasn't even in the room."""
Bruno Mars,singer,"In 2018, Mars was accused during The Grapevine, a series that explores African-American issues, of cultural appropriation on social media for using his racial ambiguity to profit from black music, and was criticized for mimicking the sound of past artists. Various black celebrities, including Stevie Wonder, Charlie Wilson, 9th Wonder, Marjua Estevez, and Stereo Williams dismissed the accusations. Mars has spoken often about his influences and has given credit to several black artists including Babyface, Teddy Riley, and Jimmy Jam & Terry Lewis. In 2021, during an interview on The Breakfast Club, Mars responded to the criticism, ""The only reason why I'm here is because of James Brown, is because of Prince, Michael [Jackson] ... that's it. This music comes from love and if you can't hear that, then I don't know what to tell you."""
Bruno Mars,singer,=== Legal issues ===
Bruno Mars,singer,"On September 19, 2010, Mars was arrested in Las Vegas at the Hard Rock Casino for possession of cocaine. Mars pleaded guilty to felony drug possession. He was fined $2,000, sentenced to 200 hours of community service, given 12 months of probation, and required to get eight hours of drug counseling. In January 2012, his cocaine possession charges were dismissed after his attorneys informed a state court judge that he had completed community service and met the conditions of a plea deal reached a year earlier."
Bruno Mars,singer,"On January 28, 2014, Demetrius Orlandus Proctor filed a lawsuit, claiming he holds the copyright for the McCoy and Mars track ""Billionaire"". Proctor claimed he owned the copyright to the music and lyrics of the track since March 31, 2011, though the song was released a year before. As evidence, Proctor has submitted a United States Copyright Office registration certificate for ""Frisky Vol. 1 to 30 (Tapes)"", issued in 2000. Proctor accused McCoy and Mars of ""willful and intentional"" infringement of copyright, seeking the destruction of all copies of the recording. Proctor claims he has exclusive rights to reproduce and distribute the song."
Bruno Mars,singer,"""Uptown Funk"" by Ronson and Mars has received various accusations and lawsuits over copyright infringement. In 2015, similarities with ""Oops Up Side Your Head"" (1979) by the Gap Band led them, along with keyboardist Rudolph Taylor, and producer Lonnie Simmons to be added as co-writers of ""Uptown Funk"" and receive publishing royalties. In the same year, Serbian artist Viktorija argued that ""Uptown Funk"" infringed on one of her tracks. She decided not to sue Mars and Ronson. In 2016, electro-funk band Collage sued Ronson and Mars for copying their single, ""Young Girls"" (1983), while the Sequence, a rap group, claimed it infringed their single ""Funk You Up"" (1979) and sued a year later.

Charli XCX,singer,== Early life ==
Charli XCX,singer,"Charlotte Emma Aitchison was born in Cambridge on 2 August 1992, the only child of nurse and flight attendant Shameera and entrepreneur and show booker Jon Aitchison. Her mother was born into a Muslim family of Gujarati Indian descent in Uganda, while her father is Scottish. She grew up in Start Hill, Essex, and attended Bishop's Stortford College in nearby Bishop's Stortford."
Charli XCX,singer,"She has spoken extensively about her difficulties at school growing up, stating that she was a ""half-Indian girl with frizzy hair"" among predominantly white people and that she was bullied and discriminated against for her Indian heritage. She demonstrated an affinity for music from an early age, being interested in acts such as the Spice Girls and Britney Spears, and began writing songs at the age of 14."
Charli XCX,singer,== Career ==
Charli XCX,singer,=== 2008–2013: Career beginnings and True Romance ===
Charli XCX,singer,"At 14, Aitchison persuaded her parents to grant her a loan to record her first album, 14, and in early 2008, began posting songs from the album, as well as numerous other demos, on her official Myspace page. This caught the attention of a promoter running numerous illegal warehouse raves and parties in East London, who invited her to perform at them. She was billed on flyers under the stage name Charli XCX; ""XCX"" (or ""kiss Charli kiss"") was her MSN Messenger display name when she was younger. Despite the illicit nature of the gigs, her parents were supportive of her career and attended several raves with her. In late 2008, while 14 was never commercially released, she released the two singles ""!Franchesckaar!"" and double A-side ""Emelline""/""Art Bitch"" under Orgy Music. She has since frequently expressed her distaste for her music of the time, going as far to call it ""gimmicky dance tracks"" and ""fucking terrible Myspace music"". At the age of 18, Charli moved to London to study for a fine art degree at UCL's Slade School of Fine Art but dropped out in her second year."
Charli XCX,singer,"In 2010, Charli XCX was signed to Asylum Records. She later described herself as being ""lost"". In an interview with The Guardian, Charli XCX said, ""I was still in school. I'd just come out of this weird rave scene, and I wasn't really sure what to make of that. And, when I got signed, I hated pop music; I wanted to make bad rap music. I didn't know who I was. I didn't know what I liked. Even though I was signed, I was still figuring it out."" She eventually flew to Los Angeles to meet producers and found it ""wasn't working out for me"" until she met with American producer Ariel Rechtshaid. They had a two-hour session and wrote the song ""Stay Away"". She stated that was ""when things started to come together"". Early in 2011, she was featured on the Alex Metric single ""End of the World"". She left during the second year of her degree course at the Slade School of Fine Art to focus on her music career. In May and November 2011, she released the singles ""Stay Away"" and ""Nuclear Seasons"" respectively, and gained attention from music website Pitchfork, where she earned ""Best New Track"" accolades for both; the former was eventually named to the site's ""Best Tracks of 2011"" list."
Charli XCX,singer,"In addition to Rechtshaid, she began working with Swedish producer Patrik Berger. He sent her two beats, and she quickly wrote songs for each, one of which became ""I Love It"" and the other of which became ""You're the One"". She stated she did not end up releasing ""I Love It"" herself as she could not reconcile it with her sound, but in 2012, Swedish duo Icona Pop re-recorded the song and released it as a single featuring her vocals. The song became an international hit, hitting number one in Charli's home country and climbing to number seven on the Billboard Hot 100 in 2013. In June, she released ""You're the One"" as a single from her EP of the same name, followed by her debut mixtape Heartbreaks and Earthquakes, a one-track file consisting of eight songs, including a cover of the Blood Orange song ""Champagne Coast"" and Odd Future's remix of ""You're the One"". On Halloween, she released a new song called ""Cloud Aura"" featuring Brooke Candy, followed by her second mixtape Super Ultra, released exclusively through her website in November. In early 2013, she released ""You (Ha Ha Ha)"" and announced her debut album, followed by ""What I Like"" in March. True Romance was released in April 2013. It peaked at number 85 on the UK Albums Chart, at number five on the US Billboard Top Heatseekers, and at number 11 on the Australian Hitseekers Albums Chart. The album was received well by music critics, earning a 76/100 on Metacritic, which assigns a normalised rating out of 100 based on reviews from mainstream critics, indicating the album's ""generally favorable reviews"".

Charli XCX,singer,"Charli XCX began writing her second album in mid-2013, saying she initially wanted to go to India to record, but later decided she wanted to record in France, she said: ""Two months ago, I wanted to go to India and record it, and now I want to record it in France. So I feel like nothing is definite – like, I feel very all-over-the-place at the moment. But at the moment, my heart's set on going to France and recording it, but that was different two months ago, so who knows what's going to happen?"" Frustrated with the music industry, she ended up going to Sweden, isolating herself from her record label, and made a punk-inspired album over a month. Charli worked on the album with Patrik Berger; of their process, she later reflected that it was ""not thought-about, everything really spontaneous [...] We don't think – it's like the first thing that comes out of my mouth is the cut on the record.""

The album included a song called ""Mow That Lawn"", which was debuted live a year later at Ilosaarirock Festival in Finland."

Charli explained in her tour diary with Replay Laserblast that the record's genre is still pop but has a very shouty, girl-power, girl-gang, Bow Wow Wow feel to it at the same time.

Lady Gaga,singer,"Stefani Joanne Angelina Germanotta (born March 28, 1986), known professionally as Lady Gaga, is an American singer, songwriter and actress. Known for her image reinventions and versatility across the entertainment industry, she is an influential figure in popular music."
Lady Gaga,singer,"After signing with Interscope Records in 2007, Gaga achieved global recognition with her debut album, The Fame (2008), and its reissue The Fame Monster (2009). The project scored a string of successful singles, including ""Just Dance"", ""Poker Face"", ""Bad Romance"", ""Telephone"", and ""Alejandro"". Her second full-length album, Born This Way (2011), explored electronic rock and techno-pop and sold more than one million copies first-week. Its title track became the fastest-selling song on the iTunes Store, with over one million downloads in less than a week. Following her electronic dance music-influenced third album, Artpop (2013), she pursued jazz on the album Cheek to Cheek (2014) with Tony Bennett, and delved into soft rock on the album Joanne (2016)."
Lady Gaga,singer,"Gaga also ventured into acting, winning awards for her leading roles in the miniseries American Horror Story: Hotel (2015–2016) and the films A Star Is Born (2018) and House of Gucci (2021). Her contributions to the A Star Is Born soundtrack, which spawned the chart-topping single ""Shallow"", made her the first woman to win an Academy, BAFTA, Golden Globe, and Grammy Award in one year. Gaga returned to dance-pop with her album Chromatica (2020), which yielded the number-one single ""Rain on Me"". She reunited with Bennett for their second and final collaborative album, Love for Sale (2021), and incorporated industrial dance music on the upcoming album, Mayhem (2025), which contains the chart-topping single ""Die with a Smile""."
Lady Gaga,singer,"Having sold an estimated 170 million records, Gaga is one of the world's best selling music artists and the only female artist to have four singles each sell at least 10 million copies globally. Five of her studio albums debuted atop the US Billboard 200. According to Forbes, she was the world's highest-paid female musician and the most powerful celebrity in 2011, while Time named her one of the 100 most influential people in the world in 2010 and 2019. She has been ranked among the greatest artists of all time by various publications.

Her business ventures include vegan cosmetics brand Haus Labs, launched in 2019."
Lady Gaga,singer,== Life and career ==
Lady Gaga,singer,=== 1986–2004: Early life ===
Lady Gaga,singer,"Stefani Joanne Angelina Germanotta was born into an upper-middle-class Catholic family on March 28, 1986, at Lenox Hill Hospital in Manhattan, New York City. Both of her parents have Italian ancestry. Her parents are Cynthia Louise (née Bissett), a philanthropist and business executive, and Internet entrepreneur Joseph Germanotta, and she has a younger sister named Natali. Brought up on the Upper West Side of Manhattan, Gaga said in an interview that her parents came from lower-class families and worked hard for everything. From age 11, she attended the Convent of the Sacred Heart, a private all-girls Roman Catholic school. Gaga has described her high-school self as ""very dedicated, very studious, very disciplined"" but also ""a bit insecure"". She considered herself a misfit and was mocked for ""being either too provocative or too eccentric""."
Lady Gaga,singer,"Gaga began playing the piano at age four when her mother insisted she become ""a cultured young woman"". She took piano lessons and practiced through her childhood. The lessons taught her to create music by ear, which Gaga preferred over reading sheet music. Her parents encouraged her to pursue music and enrolled her in Creative Arts Camp. As a teenager, she played at open mic nights. Gaga played the lead roles of Adelaide in the play Guys and Dolls and Philia in the play A Funny Thing Happened on the Way to the Forum at Regis High School. She also studied method acting at the Lee Strasberg Theatre and Film Institute for ten years. Her screen debut was a background appearance in the 2000 music video for AC/DC's song ""Stiff Upper Lip"". Gaga unsuccessfully auditioned for New York shows, though did appear in a small background role as a high-school student in a 2001 episode of The Sopranos titled ""The Telltale Moozadell"". She later said of her inclination towards music:"
Lady Gaga,singer,"I don't know exactly where my affinity for music comes from, but it is the thing that comes easiest to me. When I was like three years old, I may have been even younger, my mom always tells this really embarrassing story of me propping myself up and playing the keys like this because I was too young and short to get all the way up there. Just go like this on the low end of the piano ... I was really, really good at piano, so my first instincts were to work so hard at practicing piano, and I might not have been a natural dancer, but I am a natural musician. That is the thing that I believe I am the greatest at."
Lady Gaga,singer,"In 2003, Gaga gained early admission to Collaborative Arts Project 21, a music school at New York University (NYU)'s Tisch School of the Arts, and lived in an NYU dorm. She studied music there and improved her songwriting skills by writing essays on art, religion, social issues, and politics, including a thesis on pop artists Spencer Tunick and Damien Hirst. In 2005, Gaga withdrew from school during the second semester of her second year to focus on her music career. That year, she also played an unsuspecting diner customer for MTV's Boiling Points, a prank reality television show."
Lady Gaga,singer,"In a 2014 interview, Gaga discussed being raped at age 19 by her producer, and later undergoing mental and physical therapy for this. She has post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and attributes it to the incident, and has credited support from doctors, family, and friends with helping her. Gaga later gave additional details about the rape, including that ""the person who raped me dropped me off pregnant on a corner at my parents' house because I was vomiting and sick. Because I'd been being abused. I was locked away in a studio for months."""
Lady Gaga,singer,=== 2005–2007: Career beginnings ===
Lady Gaga,singer,"In 2005, Gaga recorded two songs with rapper Melle Mel for an audio book accompanying Cricket Casey's children's novel The Portal in the Park. She also formed a band called the SGBand with some friends from NYU. They played gigs around New York and became a fixture of the downtown Lower East Side club scene. After the 2006 Songwriters Hall of Fame New Songwriters Showcase at the Cutting Room in June, talent scout Wendy Starland recommended her to music producer Rob Fusari. Fusari collaborated with Gaga, who traveled daily to New Jersey, helping to develop her songs and compose new material. The producer said they began dating in May 2006, and claimed to have been the first person to call her ""Lady Gaga"", which was derived from Queen's song ""Radio Ga Ga"". According to his account, the name was coined when on one occasion he attempted to call her ""Radio Ga Ga"" via text message, but the spell checker autocorrected ""Radio"" to ""Lady"". Their relationship lasted until January 2007."
Lady Gaga,singer,"Fusari and Gaga established a company called ""Team Lovechild, LLC"" to promote her career. They recorded and produced electropop tracks, sending them to music industry executives. Joshua Sarubin, the head of Artists and repertoire (A&R) at Def Jam Recordings, responded positively and, after approval from Sarubin's boss Antonio ""L.A."" Reid, Gaga was signed to Def Jam in September 2006. She was dropped from the label three months later and returned to her family home for Christmas. Gaga began performing at neo-burlesque shows, and said these represented freedom to her. During this time, she met performance artist Lady Starlight, who helped mold her onstage persona. The pair began performing at downtown club venues like the Mercury Lounge, the Bitter End, and the Rockwood Music Hall. Their live performance art piece, known as ""Lady Gaga and the Starlight Revue"" and billed as ""The Ultimate Pop Burlesque Rockshow"", was a tribute to 1970s variety acts. They performed at the 2007 Lollapalooza music festival."
Lady Gaga,singer,"Having initially focused on avant-garde electronic dance music, Gaga began to incorporate pop melodies and the glam rock style of David Bowie and Queen into her songs. While Gaga and Starlight were performing, Fusari continued to develop the songs he had created with her, sending them to the producer and record executive Vincent Herbert. In November 2007, Herbert signed Gaga to his label Streamline Records, an imprint of Interscope Records, established that month. Gaga later credited Herbert as the man who discovered her. Having served as an apprentice songwriter during an internship at Famous Music Publishing, Gaga struck a music publishing deal with Sony/ATV Music Publishing. As a result, she was hired to write songs for Britney Spears, New Kids on the Block, Fergie, and the Pussycat Dolls. At Interscope, musician Akon was impressed with her singing abilities when she sang a reference vocal for one of his tracks in studio. Akon convinced Jimmy Iovine, chairman and CEO of Interscope Geffen A&M Records (a brother company for Def Jam), to form a joint deal by having Gaga also sign with his own label KonLive Distribution, making her his ""franchise player""."
Lady Gaga,singer,"In late 2007, Gaga met with songwriter and producer RedOne. She collaborated with him in the recording studio for a week on her debut album, signing with Cherrytree Records, an Interscope imprint established by producer and songwriter Martin Kierszenbaum; she also wrote four songs with Kierszenbaum. Despite securing a record deal, she said that some radio stations found her music too ""racy"", ""dance-oriented"", and ""underground"" for the mainstream market, to which she replied: ""My name is Lady Gaga, I've been on the music scene for years, and I'm telling you, this is what's next."""
Lady Gaga,singer,=== 2008–2010: Breakthrough with The Fame and The Fame Monster ===
Lady Gaga,singer,"By 2008, Gaga had relocated to Los Angeles to work extensively with her record label to complete her debut album, The Fame, and to set up her own creative team called the Haus of Gaga, modeled on Andy Warhol's The Factory. The Fame was released on August 19, 2008, and reached number one in Austria, Canada, Germany, Ireland, Switzerland and the UK, as well as the top five in Australia and the US. Its first two singles, ""Just Dance"" and ""Poker Face"", reached number one in the United States, Australia, Canada and the UK. The latter was also the world's bestselling single of 2009, with 9.8 million copies sold that year, and spent a record 83 weeks on Billboard magazine's Digital Songs chart. Three other singles, ""Eh, Eh (Nothing Else I Can Say)"", ""LoveGame"" and ""Paparazzi"", were released from the album; the lattermost reached number one in Germany. Remixed versions of the singles from The Fame, except ""Eh, Eh (Nothing Else I Can Say)"", were included on Hitmixes in August 2009. At the 52nd Annual Grammy Awards, The Fame and ""Poker Face"" won Best Dance/Electronica Album and Best Dance Recording, respectively."
Lady Gaga,singer,"Following her opening act on the Pussycat Dolls' 2009 Doll Domination Tour in Europe and Oceania, Gaga headlined her worldwide The Fame Ball Tour, which ran from March to September 2009. While traveling the globe, she wrote eight songs for The Fame Monster, a reissue of The Fame. Those new songs were also released as a standalone EP on November 18, 2009. Its first single, ""Bad Romance"", was released one month earlier and went number one in Canada and the UK, and number two in the US, Australia and New Zealand. ""Telephone"", with Beyoncé, followed as the second single from the EP and became Gaga's fourth UK number one. Its third single was ""Alejandro"", which reached number one in Finland and attracted controversy when its music video was deemed blasphemous by the Catholic League. Both tracks reached the top five in the US. The video for ""Bad Romance"" became the most watched on YouTube in April 2010, and that October, Gaga became the first person with more than one billion combined views. At the 2010 MTV Video Music Awards, she won eight awards from 13 nominations, including Video of the Year for ""Bad Romance"". She was the most nominated artist for a single year, and the first woman to receive two nominations for Video of the Year at the same ceremony. The Fame Monster won the Grammy Award for Best Pop Vocal Album, and ""Bad Romance"" won Best Female Pop Vocal Performance and Best Short Form Music Video at the 53rd Annual Grammy Awards. Rolling Stone featured ""Bad Romance"" and its music video on their respective lists of the ""500 Greatest Songs of All Time"" and ""100 Greatest Music Videos of All Time"" in 2021."
Lady Gaga,singer,"In 2009, Gaga spent a record 150 weeks on the UK Singles Chart and became the most downloaded female act in a year in the US, with 11.1 million downloads sold, earning an entry in the Guinness Book of World Records. Worldwide, The Fame and The Fame Monster together have sold more than 15 million copies, and the latter was 2010's second bestselling album. Its success allowed Gaga to start her second worldwide concert tour, The Monster Ball Tour, and release The Remix, her final record with Cherrytree Records and among the bestselling remix albums of all time. The Monster Ball Tour ran from November 2009 to May 2011 and grossed $227.4 million, making it the highest-grossing concert tour for a debut headlining artist. Concerts performed at Madison Square Garden in New York City were filmed for an HBO television special, Lady Gaga Presents the Monster Ball Tour: At Madison Square Garden. Gaga also performed songs from her albums at the 2009 Royal Variety Performance, the 52nd Annual Grammy Awards, and the 2010 Brit Awards. Before Michael Jackson's death, Gaga was set to take part in his canceled This Is It concert series at the O2 Arena in the UK."
Lady Gaga,singer,"During this era, Gaga ventured into business, collaborating with consumer electronics company Monster Cable Products to create in-ear, jewel-encrusted headphones called Heartbeats by Lady Gaga. She also partnered with Polaroid in January 2010 as their creative director and announced a suite of photo-capture products called Grey Label. Her collaboration with her past record producer and ex-boyfriend Rob Fusari led to a lawsuit against her production team, Mermaid Music LLC. At this time, Gaga was tested borderline positive for lupus but claimed not to be affected by the symptoms and hoped to maintain a healthy lifestyle."
Lady Gaga,singer,"=== 2011–2014: Born This Way, Artpop, and Cheek to Cheek ==="
Lady Gaga,singer,"In February 2011, Gaga released ""Born This Way"", the lead single from her studio album of the same name. The song sold more than one million copies within five days, earning the Guinness World Record for the fastest selling single on iTunes. It debuted atop the Billboard Hot 100, becoming the 1,000th number-one single in the history of the charts. Its second single ""Judas"" followed two months later, and ""The Edge of Glory"" served as its third single. Both reached the top 10 in the US and the UK. Her music video for ""The Edge of Glory"", unlike her previous work, portrays her dancing on a fire escape and walking on a lonely street, without intricate choreography and back-up dancers."
Lady Gaga,singer,"Born This Way was released on May 23, 2011, and debuted atop the Billboard 200 with first-week sales of 1.1 million copies. It sold eight million copies worldwide and received three Grammy nominations, including Gaga's third consecutive nomination for Album of the Year. Rolling Stone listed the record among ""The 500 Greatest Albums of All Time"" in 2020. Born This Way's following singles were ""You and I"" and ""Marry the Night"", which reached numbers 6 and 29 in the US, respectively. Its cut, ""Bloody Mary"", became a resurgent success and was released as a single in 2022. While filming the ""You and I"" music video, Gaga met and started dating actor Taylor Kinney in July 2011, who played her love interest. She also embarked on the Born This Way Ball tour in April 2012, which was scheduled to conclude the following March, but ended one month earlier when Gaga canceled the remaining dates due to a labral tear of her right hip that required surgery. While refunds for the cancellations were estimated to be worth $25 million, the tour grossed $183.9 million globally."
Lady Gaga,singer,"In 2011, Gaga also worked with Tony Bennett on a jazz version of ""The Lady Is a Tramp"", with Elton John on ""Hello Hello"" for the animated feature film Gnomeo & Juliet, and with The Lonely Island and Justin Timberlake on ""3-Way (The Golden Rule)"". She also performed a concert at the Sydney Town Hall in Australia that year to promote Born This Way and to celebrate former US President Bill Clinton's 65th birthday. In November, she was featured in a Thanksgiving television special titled A Very Gaga Thanksgiving, which attracted 5.7 million American viewers and spawned the release of her fourth EP, A Very Gaga Holiday. In 2012, Gaga guest-starred as an animated version of herself in an episode of The Simpsons called ""Lisa Goes Gaga"", and released her first fragrance, Lady Gaga Fame, followed by a second one, Eau de Gaga, in 2014."
Lady Gaga,singer,"Gaga began work on her third studio album, Artpop, in early 2012, during the Born This Way Ball tour. She crafted the album to mirror ""a night at the club"". In August 2013, Gaga released the album's lead single ""Applause"", which reached number one in Hungary, number four in the US, and number five in the UK. A lyric video for Artpop track ""Aura"" followed in October to accompany Robert Rodriguez's Machete Kills, where she plays an assassin named La Chameleon. The film received generally mixed reviews and earned less than half of its $33 million budget. The second Artpop single, ""Do What U Want"", featured singer R. Kelly and was released later that month, topping the charts in Hungary and reaching number 13 in the US. Artpop was released on November 6, 2013, to mixed reviews. Helen Brown of The Daily Telegraph criticized Gaga for making another album about her fame and doubted the record's originality, but found it ""great for dancing"". The album debuted atop the Billboard 200 chart, and sold more than 2.5 million copies worldwide as of July 2014. ""G.U.Y."" was released as the third single in March 2014 and peaked at number 76 in the US."
Lady Gaga,singer,"Gaga hosted an episode of Saturday Night Live in November 2013. After holding her second Thanksgiving Day television special on ABC, Lady Gaga and the Muppets Holiday Spectacular, she performed a special rendition of ""Do What U Want"" with Christina Aguilera on the fifth season of the American reality talent show The Voice. In March 2014, Gaga had a seven-day concert residency commemorating the last performance at New York's Roseland Ballroom before its closure. Two months later, she embarked on the ArtRave: The Artpop Ball tour, building on concepts from her ArtRave promotional event. Earning $83 million, the tour included cities canceled from the Born This Way Ball tour itinerary. In the meantime, Gaga split from longtime manager Troy Carter over ""creative differences"", and by June 2014, she and new manager Bobby Campbell joined Artist Nation, the artist management division of Live Nation Entertainment. She briefly appeared in Rodriguez's Sin City: A Dame to Kill For, and was confirmed as Versace's spring-summer 2014 ambassador with a campaign called ""Lady Gaga For Versace""."
Lady Gaga,singer,"In September 2014, Gaga released a collaborative jazz album with Tony Bennett titled Cheek to Cheek. The inspiration behind the album came from her friendship with Bennett, and fascination with jazz music since her childhood. He stated that Gaga is ""the most talented artist I have ever met"". Before the album was released, it produced the singles ""Anything Goes"" and ""I Can't Give You Anything but Love"". Cheek to Cheek received generally favorable reviews; The Guardian's Caroline Sullivan praised Gaga's vocals and Howard Reich of the Chicago Tribune wrote that ""Cheek to Cheek serves up the real thing, start to finish"". The record was Gaga's third consecutive number-one album on the Billboard 200, and won a Grammy Award for Best Traditional Pop Vocal Album. The duo recorded the concert special Tony Bennett and Lady Gaga: Cheek to Cheek Live!, and embarked on the Cheek to Cheek Tour from December 2014 to August 2015."
Lady Gaga,singer,"=== 2015–2017: American Horror Story, Joanne, and Super Bowl performances ==="
Lady Gaga,singer,"In February 2015, Gaga became engaged to Taylor Kinney. After the lukewarm response to Artpop, Gaga began to reinvent her image and style. According to Billboard, this shift started with the release of Cheek to Cheek and the attention she received for her performance at the 87th Academy Awards, where she sang a medley of songs from The Sound of Music in a tribute to Julie Andrews. Considered one of her best performances by Billboard, it triggered more than 214,000 interactions per minute globally on Facebook. She and Diane Warren co-wrote the song ""Til It Happens to You"" for the documentary The Hunting Ground, which earned them the Satellite Award for Best Original Song and an Academy Award nomination in the same category. Billboard named Gaga their 2015 Woman of the Year."
Lady Gaga,singer,"Gaga had spent much of her early life wanting to be an actress, and achieved her goal when she starred in American Horror Story: Hotel. Running from October 2015 to January 2016, Hotel is the fifth season of the television anthology horror series, American Horror Story, in which Gaga played a hotel owner named Elizabeth. At the 73rd Golden Globe Awards, Gaga received the Best Actress in a Miniseries or Television Film award for her work on the season. She appeared in Nick Knight's 2015 fashion film for Tom Ford's 2016 spring campaign and was guest editor for V fashion magazine's 99th issue in January 2016, which featured 16 different covers. She received Editor of the Year award at the Fashion Los Angeles Awards."
Lady Gaga,singer,"In February 2016, Gaga sang the US national anthem at Super Bowl 50, partnered with Intel and Nile Rodgers for a tribute performance to the late David Bowie at the 58th Annual Grammy Awards, and sang ""Til It Happens to You"" at the 88th Academy Awards, where she was introduced by Joe Biden and was accompanied on-stage by 50 people who had suffered from sexual assault. Her engagement to Taylor Kinney ended in July; she later said her career had interfered with their relationship."
Lady Gaga,singer,"Gaga played a witch named Scathach in American Horror Story: Roanoke, the series' sixth season, which ran from September to November 2016. Her role in the fifth season of the show ultimately influenced her future music, prompting her to feature ""the art of darkness"". In September 2016, she released her fifth album's lead single, ""Perfect Illusion"", which topped the charts in France and reached number 15 in the US. The album, titled Joanne, was named after Gaga's late aunt, who was an inspiration for the music. It was released on October 21, 2016, and became Gaga's fourth number one album on the Billboard 200, making her the first woman to reach the US chart's summit four times in the 2010s. The album's second single, ""Million Reasons"", followed the next month and reached number four in the US. She later released a piano version of the album's title track in 2018, which won a Grammy for Best Pop Solo Performance. To promote the album, Gaga embarked on the three-date Dive Bar Tour."
Lady Gaga,singer,"Gaga performed as the headlining act during the Super Bowl LI halftime show on February 5, 2017. Her performance featured a group of hundreds of lighted drones forming various shapes in the sky above Houston's NRG Stadium—the first time robotic aircraft appeared in a Super Bowl program. It attracted 117.5 million viewers in the United States, exceeding the game's 111.3 million viewers and making it the third most-watched Super Bowl halftime show at the time. The performance led to a surge of 410,000 song downloads in the United States for Gaga and earned her an Emmy nomination in the Outstanding Special Class Program category. CBS Sports included her performance as the second best in the history of Super Bowl halftime shows. In April, Gaga headlined the Coachella Valley Music and Arts Festival. She also released a standalone single, ""The Cure"", which reached the top 10 in Australia. Four months later, Gaga began the Joanne World Tour, which she announced after the Super Bowl LI halftime show. Gaga's creation of Joanne and preparation for her halftime show performance were featured in the documentary Gaga: Five Foot Two, which premiered on Netflix that September. Throughout the film, she was seen suffering from chronic pain, which was later revealed to be the effect of a long-term condition called fibromyalgia. In February 2018, it prompted Gaga to cancel the last ten shows of the Joanne World Tour, which ultimately grossed $95 million from 842,000 tickets sold."
Lady Gaga,singer,=== 2018–2019: A Star Is Born and Las Vegas residency ===
Lady Gaga,singer,"In March 2018, Gaga supported the March for Our Lives gun-control rally in Washington, D.C., and released a cover of Elton John's ""Your Song"" for his tribute album Revamp. Later that year, she starred as struggling singer Ally in Bradley Cooper's musical romantic drama A Star Is Born, a remake of the 1937 film of the same name. The film follows Ally's relationship with singer Jackson Maine (played by Cooper), which becomes strained after her career begins to overshadow his. It received acclaim from critics, with a consensus that the movie had ""appealing leads, deft direction, and an affecting love story"". Cooper approached Gaga after seeing her perform at a cancer research fundraiser. An admirer of Cooper's work, Gaga agreed to the project due to its portrayal of addiction and depression. A Star Is Born premiered at the 2018 Venice Film Festival, and was released worldwide that October. Gaga's performance was acclaimed by film critics, with Peter Bradshaw of The Guardian labeling the film ""outrageously watchable"" and stating that ""Gaga's ability to be part ordinary person, part extraterrestrial celebrity empress functions at the highest level"". Stephanie Zacharek of Time magazine similarly highlighted her ""knockout performance"" and found her to be ""charismatic"" without her usual makeup, wigs and costumes. For the role, Gaga won the National Board of Review and Critics' Choice awards for Best Actress, in addition to receiving nominations for the Academy Award, Golden Globe Award, Screen Actors Guild Award and BAFTA Award for Best Actress."
Lady Gaga,singer,"Gaga and Cooper co-wrote and produced most of the songs on the soundtrack for A Star Is Born, which she insisted they perform live in the film. Its lead single, ""Shallow"", performed by the two, was released on September 27, 2018 and topped the charts in various countries including Australia, the UK and the US. The soundtrack contains 34 tracks, including 17 original songs, and received generally positive reviews; Mark Kennedy of The Washington Post called it a ""five-star marvel"" and Ben Beaumont-Thomas of The Guardian termed it an ""instant classics full of Gaga's emotional might"".

""Shallow"" also won her the Academy Award, Golden Globe Award, Critics' Choice Award, and Satellite Award for Best Original Song. Gaga gave live performances of the song at the 61st Annual Grammy Awards and the 91st Academy Awards."
Lady Gaga,singer,"In October, Gaga announced her engagement to talent agent Christian Carino whom she had met in early 2017. They ended the engagement in February 2019. Gaga signed a concert residency, named Lady Gaga Enigma + Jazz & Piano, to perform at the MGM Park Theater in Las Vegas. The residency consisted of two types of shows: Enigma, which focused on theatricality and included Gaga's biggest hits, and Jazz & Piano, which involved tracks from the Great American Songbook and stripped-down versions of Gaga's songs. The Enigma show opened in December 2018 and the Jazz & Piano in January 2019. Gaga launched her vegan makeup line, Haus Laboratories, in September 2019 exclusively on Amazon.

In February 2021, her dog walker Ryan Fischer was hospitalized after getting shot in Hollywood. Two of her French Bulldogs, Koji and Gustav, were taken while a third dog named Miss Asia escaped and was subsequently recovered by police. Gaga later offered a $500,000 reward for the return of her pets. Two days later, on February 26, a woman brought the dogs to a police station in Los Angeles. Both were unharmed. Los Angeles Police initially said the woman who dropped off the dogs did not appear to be involved with the shooting, but on April 29, she was one of five people charged in connection with the shooting and theft. In December 2022, James Howard Jackson, the man who shot Fischer, was sentenced to 21 years in prison."
Lady Gaga,singer,"In April 2021, Gaga teamed up with Champagne brand Dom Pérignon, and appeared in an ad shot by Nick Knight. On September 3, she released her third remix album, Dawn of Chromatica. This was followed by her second collaborative album with Tony Bennett, titled Love for Sale, on September 30. The record received generally favorable reviews, and debuted at number eight in the US.

At the 64th Annual Grammy Awards, Love for Sale won Gaga and Bennett the award for Best Traditional Pop Vocal Album."
Lady Gaga,singer,"After an appearance in the television special Friends: The Reunion, in which Gaga sang ""Smelly Cat"" with Lisa Kudrow, she portrayed Patrizia Reggiani, who was convicted of hiring a hitman to murder her ex-husband and former head of the Gucci fashion house Maurizio Gucci (played by Adam Driver), in Ridley Scott's biographical crime film titled House of Gucci. For the part, Gaga learned to speak with an Italian accent. She also stayed in character for 18 months, speaking with an accent for nine months during that period. Her method acting took a toll on her mental wellbeing, and towards the end of filming she had to be accompanied on-set by a psychiatric nurse. The film was released on November 24, 2021, to mixed reviews, though critics praised Gaga's performance as ""note-perfect"". She earned the New York Film Critics Circle Award, and nominations for the BAFTA Award, Critics' Choice Award, Golden Globe Award and Screen Actors Guild Award for Best Actress."

Lady Gaga,singer,=== 2024–present: Joker: Folie à Deux and Mayhem ===
Lady Gaga,singer,"Gaga was the featured artist for season two of the online video game Fortnite spin-off, Fortnite Festival, which ran from February to April 2024. She became engaged to entrepreneur Michael Polansky that April, four years after they began dating. In July, she performed a rendition of Zizi Jeanmaire's ""Mon truc en plumes"" at the 2024 Summer Olympics opening ceremony in Paris. Gaga released the single ""Die with a Smile"", a duet with Bruno Mars, on August 16, 2024. Aside from topping the Billboard Global 200 for nine weeks, it made Gaga the first act to achieve multiple U.S. number-one songs in the 2000s, 2010s, and 2020s. At the 67th Annual Grammy Awards, the song earned the trophy for Best Pop Duo/Group Performance, making her the first artist to win the category three times."
Lady Gaga,singer,"Gaga starred as Harleen ""Lee"" Quinzel alongside Joaquin Phoenix in Todd Phillips's musical psychological thriller Joker: Folie à Deux, the sequel to his 2019 film Joker. It premiered at the 81st Venice International Film Festival, and was released theatrically in October 2024. While the film was a critical and commercial failure, Gaga's performance was better received, with critics finding her to be underused.

Lady Gaga,singer,== Artistry ==
Lady Gaga,singer,=== Influences ===
Lady Gaga,singer,"Gaga grew up listening to artists such as Michael Jackson, the Beatles, Stevie Wonder, Queen, Bruce Springsteen, Pink Floyd, Led Zeppelin, Whitney Houston, Elton John, Prince, En Vogue, TLC, Christina Aguilera, Janet Jackson, and Blondie, who have all influenced her music. Gaga's musical inspiration varies from dance-pop singers such as Madonna and Michael Jackson to glam rock artists such as David Bowie and Freddie Mercury, as well as the theatrics of the pop artist Andy Warhol and her own performance roots in musical theater. She has been compared to Madonna, who has said that she sees herself reflected in Gaga. Gaga has expressed her desire to revolutionize pop music the way Madonna did. Gaga has also cited heavy metal bands as an influence, specifically Iron Maiden, Black Sabbath and Marilyn Manson. She has credited Beyoncé as a key inspiration to pursue a musical career."
Lady Gaga,singer,"Gaga was inspired by her mother to be interested in fashion, which would later become a major influence and integrated with her music. Stylistically, Gaga has been compared to Leigh Bowery, Isabella Blow, and Cher; she once commented that as a child, she absorbed Cher's fashion sense and made it her own. Gaga became friends with British fashion designer Alexander McQueen shortly before his suicide in 2010, and became known for wearing his designs, particularly his towering armadillo shoes. She has called fashion designer Donatella Versace her muse; Versace referred to Gaga as ""the fresh Donatella"". Gaga has also been influenced by Princess Diana, whom she has admired since childhood."
Lady Gaga,singer,"Gaga has called the Indian alternative medicine advocate Deepak Chopra a ""true inspiration"", and has also quoted Indian leader Osho's book Creativity on Twitter. Gaga said she was influenced by Osho's work in valuing rebellion through creativity and equality."
Lady Gaga,singer,=== Musical style and themes ===
Lady Gaga,singer,"Critics have analyzed and scrutinized Gaga's musical and performance style, as she has experimented with new ideas and images throughout her career. She has called the continual reinvention ""liberating"", and has been drawn to it since childhood. Gaga combines a variety of music genres, particularly incorporating elements of rock into her pop and dance music. She has also branched out into jazz and other non-pop musical genres. Gaga's voice has been classified as a contralto, with a vocal range spanning from B♭2 to B5. She has changed her vocal style regularly, and deemed Born This Way ""much more vocally up to par with what I've always been capable of"". In summing up her voice, Entertainment Weekly wrote: ""There's an immense emotional intelligence behind the way she uses her voice. Almost never does she overwhelm a song with her vocal ability, recognizing instead that artistry is to be found in nuance rather than lung power."""
Lady Gaga,singer,"According to Evan Sawdey of PopMatters, Gaga managed ""to get you moving and grooving at an almost effortless pace"" with The Fame. Gaga has said that she believes ""all good music can be played on a piano and still sound like a hit"". Simon Reynolds wrote in 2010: ""Everything about Gaga came from electroclash, except the music, which wasn't particularly 1980s, just ruthlessly catchy naughties pop glazed with Auto-Tune and undergirded with R&B-ish beats."""
Lady Gaga,singer,"Gaga's songs have covered a wide variety of concepts; The Fame discusses the lust for stardom, while The Fame Monster expresses fame's dark side through monster metaphors. The Fame is an electropop and dance-pop album that has influences of 1980s pop and 1990s Europop, whereas The Fame Monster displays Gaga's taste for pastiche, drawing on ""Seventies arena glam, perky ABBA disco, and sugary throwbacks like Stacey Q"". Born This Way has lyrics in English, French, German, and Spanish and features themes common to Gaga's controversial songwriting such as sex, love, religion, money, drugs, identity, liberation, sexuality, freedom, and individualism. The album explores new genres, such as electronic rock and techno."
Lady Gaga,singer,"The themes in Artpop revolve around Gaga's personal views of fame, love, sex, feminism, self-empowerment, overcoming addiction, and reactions to media scrutiny. Billboard described Artpop as ""coherently channeling R&B, techno, disco and rock music"". With Cheek to Cheek, Gaga pursued the jazz genre. Joanne, exploring the genres of country, funk, pop, dance, rock, electronic music and folk, was influenced by her personal life. The A Star Is Born soundtrack contains elements of blues rock, country and bubblegum pop. Billboard commented that its lyrics are about wanting change, its struggle, love, romance, and bonding, describing the music as ""timeless, emotional, gritty and earnest. They sound like songs written by artists who, quite frankly, are supremely messed up but hit to the core of the listener."" On Chromatica, Gaga returned to her dance-pop roots, and discussed her struggles with mental health. Love for Sale and Harlequin expand on her venture into jazz music. The former consists of a tribute to Cole Porter, while the latter was inspired by her role in Joker: Folie à Deux. With Mayhem, influenced by industrial dance music, Gaga aimed to revisit ""the pop music my earliest fans loved."""
Lady Gaga,singer,=== Videos and stage ===
Lady Gaga,singer,"Featuring constant costume changes and provocative visuals, Gaga's music videos are often described as short films. The video for ""Telephone"" earned Gaga the Guinness World Record for Most Product Placement in a Video. According to author Curtis Fogel, she explores bondage and sadomasochism and highlights prevalent feminist themes. The main themes of her music videos are sex, violence, and power. She has called herself ""a little bit of a feminist"" and asserted that she is ""sexually empowering women"". Billboard ranked her sixth on its list of ""The 100 Greatest Music Video Artists of All Time"" in 2020, stating that ""the name 'Lady Gaga' will forever be synonymous with culture-shifting music videos""."
Lady Gaga,singer,"Regarded as ""one of the greatest living musical performers"" by Rolling Stone, Gaga has called herself a perfectionist when it comes to her elaborate shows. Her performances have been described as ""highly entertaining and innovative""; the blood-spurting performance of ""Paparazzi"" at the 2009 MTV Video Music Awards was described as ""eye-popping"" by MTV News and ranked among the best MTV VMA performances of all time by various publications. She continued the blood-soaked theme during The Monster Ball Tour, causing protests in England from family groups and fans in the aftermath of the Cumbria shootings, in which a taxi driver had killed 12 people, then himself. At the 2011 MTV Video Music Awards, Gaga appeared in drag as her male alter ego, Jo Calderone, and delivered a lovesick monologue before a performance of her song ""You and I"". As Gaga's choreographer and creative director, Laurieann Gibson provided material for her shows and videos for four years before she was replaced by her assistant Richard Jackson in 2014."
Lady Gaga,singer,"In an October 2018 article for Billboard, Rebecca Schiller traced back Gaga's videography from ""Just Dance"" to the release of A Star Is Born. Schiller noted that following the Artpop era, Gaga's stripped-down approach to music was reflected in the clips for the singles from Joanne, taking the example of the music video of lead single ""Perfect Illusion"" where she eschewed ""the elaborate outfits for shorts and a tee-shirt as she performed the song at a desert party"". It continued with her performances in the film as well as her stage persona. Reviewing The Chromatica Ball in 2022, Chris Willman of Variety wrote that Gaga ""could have further played the authenticity card for all it's worth"" after the release of Joanne and A Star Is Born, but instead ""has determined to keep herself weird — or just weird enough to provide necessarily ballast to her more earnest inclinations""."
Lady Gaga,singer,== Public image ==
Lady Gaga,singer,"Public reception of her music, fashion sense, and persona is polarized. Because of her influence on modern culture, and her rise to global fame, sociologist Mathieu Deflem of the University of South Carolina has offered a course titled ""Lady Gaga and the Sociology of the Fame"" since early 2011 with the objective of unraveling ""some of the sociologically relevant dimensions of the fame of Lady Gaga"". When Gaga met briefly with then-president Barack Obama at a Human Rights Campaign fundraiser, he found the interaction ""intimidating"" as she was dressed in 16-inch (40 cm) heels, making her the tallest woman in the room. When interviewed by Barbara Walters for her annual ABC News special 10 Most Fascinating People in 2009, Gaga dismissed the claim that she is intersex as an urban legend. Responding to a question on this issue, she expressed her fondness for androgyny."
Lady Gaga,singer,"Gaga's outlandish fashion sense has also served as an important aspect of her character. During her early career, members of the media compared her fashion choices to those of Christina Aguilera. In 2011, 121 women gathered at the Grammy Awards dressed in costumes similar to those worn by Gaga, earning the 2011 Guinness World Record for Largest Gathering of Lady Gaga Impersonators. The Global Language Monitor named ""Lady Gaga"" as the Top Fashion Buzzword with her trademark ""no pants"" a close third. Entertainment Weekly put her outfits on its end of the decade ""best-of"" list, saying that she ""brought performance art into the mainstream"". People ranked her number one on their ""Best Dressed Stars of 2021"" list, writing that Gaga ""strutted the streets in high-fashion designs, from a sculptural seersucker number to a black lace corseted gown—accessorizing each with elegant updos, sky-high heels and retro shades—like it was no sweat."""
Lady Gaga,singer,"Time placed Gaga on their All-Time 100 Fashion Icons list, stating: ""Lady Gaga is just as notorious for her outrageous style as she is for her pop hits"", mentioning outfits ""made from plastic bubbles, Kermit the Frog dolls, and raw meat"". Gaga wore a dress made of raw beef to the 2010 MTV Video Music Awards, which was supplemented by boots, a purse, and a hat also made out of raw beef. Partly awarded in recognition of the dress, Vogue named her one of the Best Dressed people of 2010 and Time named the dress the Fashion Statement of the year. It attracted the attention of worldwide media; the animal rights organization People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals (PETA) found it offensive. The meat dress was displayed at the National Museum of Women in the Arts in 2012, and entered the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in September 2015."
Lady Gaga,singer,"Gaga's fans call her ""Mother Monster"", and she often refers to them as ""Little Monsters"", a phrase she had tattooed on herself in dedication. In his article ""Lady Gaga Pioneered Online Fandom Culture As We Know It"" for Vice, Jake Hall wrote that Gaga inspired several subsequent fan-brandings, such as those of Taylor Swift, Rihanna and Justin Bieber. In July 2012, Gaga also co-founded the social networking service LittleMonsters.com, devoted to her fans. Scott Hardy, CEO of Polaroid, praised Gaga for inspiring fans and for her close interactions with them on social media."
Lady Gaga,singer,=== Censorship ===
Lady Gaga,singer,"In 2011, lyrics of Gaga's song ""Born This Way"", which reference homosexuality and LGBTQ subjects, were censored by Malaysian broadcaster AMP Radio Networks as a precaution against government restrictions against songs which might violate ""good taste or decency or [are] offensive to public feeling"". The same year, the Ministry of Culture of the People's Republic of China, reportedly enforcing a directive designed to tackle ""poor taste and vulgar content"", banned the publication of six of Gaga's songs from the album Born This Way on all Chinese music websites."
Lady Gaga,singer,"In 2014, her album Artpop was released in China with conditions being placed on the album artwork, covering her almost naked body as well as changing the title of the song ""Sexxx Dreams"" to ""X Dreams"". In 2016, her meeting with the Dalai Lama resulted in the Chinese government adding her to a list of hostile foreign forces, and Chinese websites and media organizations were ordered to stop distributing her songs. The Publicity Department of the Chinese Communist Party also issued an order for state-controlled media to condemn the meeting. In 2019, coverage of Gaga in the 91st Academy Awards was removed on some Chinese streaming platforms such as Mango TV and in 2021 her appearance was cut from Friends: The Reunion; both incidents received backlash from Chinese fans."
Lady Gaga,singer,== Activism ==
Lady Gaga,singer,=== Philanthropy ===
Lady Gaga,singer,"After declining an invitation to appear on the single ""We Are the World 25 for Haiti"", because of rehearsals for her tour, to benefit victims of the 2010 Haiti earthquake, Gaga donated the proceeds of her January 2010 Radio City Music Hall concert to the country's reconstruction relief fund. All profits from her online store that day were also donated, and Gaga announced that $500,000 was collected for the fund. Hours after the 2011 Tōhoku earthquake and tsunami hit Japan, Gaga tweeted a link to Japan Prayer Bracelets. All revenue from a bracelet she designed in conjunction with the company was donated to relief efforts; these raised $1.5 million. In June 2011, Gaga performed at MTV Japan's charity show in Makuhari Messe, which benefited the Japanese Red Cross."
Lady Gaga,singer,"In 2012, Gaga joined the campaign group Artists Against Fracking. That October, Yoko Ono gave Gaga and four other activists the LennonOno Grant for Peace in Reykjavík, Iceland. The following month, Gaga pledged to donate $1 million to the American Red Cross to help the victims of Hurricane Sandy. Gaga has also contributed to the fight against HIV and AIDS, focusing on educating young women about the risks of the disease. In collaboration with Cyndi Lauper, Gaga joined forces with MAC Cosmetics to launch a line of lipstick under their supplementary cosmetic line, Viva Glam. Sales have raised more than $202 million to fight HIV and AIDS."
Lady Gaga,singer,"In April 2016, Gaga joined Vice President Joe Biden at the University of Nevada, Las Vegas to support his It's On Us campaign as he traveled to colleges on behalf of the organization, which has seen 250,000 students from more than 530 colleges sign a pledge of solidarity and activism. Two months later, Gaga attended the 84th Annual US Conference of Mayors in Indianapolis where together with the Dalai Lama she talked about the power of kindness and how to make the world a more compassionate place."
Lady Gaga,singer,"In April 2020, Gaga curated the televised benefit concert, One World: Together at Home, a collaboration with Global Citizen to benefit the World Health Organization's COVID-19 Solidarity Response Fund. The special raised $127 million, which according to Forbes ""puts it on par with the other legendary fundraiser, Live Aid, as the highest grossing charity concert in history."" In recognition of her contribution to the Black Lives Matter movement, Gaga received the Yolanda Denise King High Ground Award from the King Center's Beloved Community Awards in January 2021. In her acceptance speech, she denounced racism and white supremacy and addressed her social responsibility as a high-profile artist and white woman."
Lady Gaga,singer,=== Born This Way Foundation ===
Lady Gaga,singer,"In 2012, Gaga launched the Born This Way Foundation (BTWF), a non-profit organization that focuses on youth empowerment. It has been named after her 2011 single and album. Media proprietor Oprah Winfrey, writer Deepak Chopra, and US Secretary of Health and Human Services Kathleen Sebelius spoke at the foundation's inauguration at Harvard University. The foundation's original funding included $1.2 million from Gaga, $500,000 from the MacArthur Foundation, and $850,000 from Barneys New York. In July 2012, the BTWF partnered with Office Depot for a series of limited edition back-to-school products, with 25% of its sales going towards the foundation, for a guaranteed donation of $1 million. The foundation's initiatives have included the ""Born Brave Bus"" that followed Gaga on tour as a youth drop-in center as an initiative against bullying."
Lady Gaga,singer,"In October 2015, at the Yale Center for Emotional Intelligence, Gaga joined 200 high school students, policy makers, and academic officials, including Peter Salovey, to discuss ways to recognize and channel emotions for positive outcomes. In 2016, the foundation partnered with Intel, Vox Media, and Recode to fight online harassment. The sales revenue of the 99th issue of the V magazine, which featured Gaga and Kinney, was donated to the foundation. Gaga and Elton John released the clothing and accessories line Love Bravery at Macy's in May 2016. 25% of each purchase benefited the BTWF and the Elton John AIDS Foundation. Gaga partnered with Starbucks for a week in June 2017 with the ""Cups of Kindness"" campaign, where the company donated 25 cents from some of the beverages sold to the foundation. She also appeared in a video by Staples Inc. to raise funds for the foundation and DonorsChoose.org."
Lady Gaga,singer,"On the 2018 World Kindness Day, Gaga partnered with the foundation to bring food and relief to a Red Cross shelter for people who have been forced to evacuate homes due to the California wildfires. The foundation also partnered with Starbucks and SoulCycle to thank California firefighters for their relief work during the crisis. Gaga had to previously evacuate her own home during the Woolsey Fire which spread through parts of Malibu. In March 2019, she penned a letter to supporters of the BTWF, announcing the launch of a new pilot program for a teen mental health first aid project with the National Council for Behavioral Health. Gaga revealed her personal struggles with mental health in her letter and how she was able to get support which saved her life: ""I know what it means to have someone support me and understand what I'm going through, and every young person in the world should have someone to turn to when they're hurting. It saved my life, and it will save theirs."""
Lady Gaga,singer,"In September 2020, Gaga released an anthology book, Channel Kindness: Stories of Kindness and Community, featuring fifty-one stories about kindness, bravery, and resilience from young people all over the world collected by the BTWF, and introduced by herself. She promoted it with a 21 days of kindness challenge on her social media, using the ""BeKind21"" hashtag. In 2021, Gaga collaborated with the Champagne house Dom Pérignon to benefit the BTWF by releasing a limited edition of Rosé Vintage 2005 bottles along with a sculpture designed by her. The 110 exclusive pieces were sold at private sales, and the profit of $570,000 was donated to the foundation. On the 2021 World Kindness Day, Gaga released a 30-minute special, titled The Power of Kindness, as part of the foundation's Channel Kindness program, in which together with a mental health expert and a group of eleven young people, she explored the connection between kindness and mental health."
Lady Gaga,singer,=== LGBTQ advocacy ===
Lady Gaga,singer,"A bisexual woman, Gaga has been actively supporting LGBTQ rights worldwide. She has attributed much of her early success as a mainstream artist to her gay fans and is considered a gay icon. Early in her career, Gaga had difficulty getting radio airplay, and stated: ""The turning point for me was the gay community."" She thanked FlyLife, a Manhattan-based LGBTQ marketing company which worked with her label Interscope at the time, in the liner notes of The Fame. One of her first televised performances was in May 2008 at the NewNowNext Awards, an awards show aired by the LGBTQ television network Logo."
Lady Gaga,singer,"Gaga spoke at the 2009 National Equality March in Washington, D.C., to support the LGBTQ rights movement. She attended the 2010 MTV Video Music Awards accompanied by four gay and lesbian former members of the United States Armed Forces who had been unable to serve openly under the US military's ""don't ask, don't tell"" policy, which banned open homosexuality in the military. Gaga urged her fans via YouTube to contact their senators in an effort to overturn the policy. In September 2010, she spoke at a Servicemembers Legal Defense Network's rally in Portland, Maine. Following this event, The Advocate named her a ""fierce advocate"" for gays and lesbians."
Lady Gaga,singer,"Gaga appeared at Europride, an international event dedicated to LGBTQ pride, in Rome in June 2011. She criticized the poor state of gay rights in many European countries and described gay people as ""revolutionaries of love"". Later that year, she was referenced by teenager Jamey Rodemeyer in the hours prior to his death, with Rodemeyer having tweeted ""@ladygaga bye mother monster, thank you for all you have done, paws up forever"". Rodemeyer's suicide prompted Gaga to meet with then-President Barack Obama in order to address anti-gay bullying in American schools. She later endorsed him during the 2012 US presidential election. In 2011, Gaga was also ordained as a minister by the Universal Life Church Monastery allowing her to officiate the wedding of two female friends."
Lady Gaga,singer,"In June 2016, during a vigil held in Los Angeles for victims of the attack at the gay nightclub Pulse in Orlando, Gaga read aloud the names of the 49 people killed in the attack, and gave a speech. Following Joan Jett, Gaga was the second of nearly 200 musicians and music industry executives to sign Billboard's Open Letter on Gun Violence, demanding that Congress enact universal background checks on all gun buyers. Gaga also appeared in Human Rights Campaign's tribute video to the victims of the attack. She opposed the presidency of Donald Trump and his military transgender ban. She supported former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton for president in 2016. In 2018, a leaked memo from Trump's office revealed that his administration wanted to change the legal definition of sex to exclude transgender Americans. Gaga was one of the many celebrities to condemn him and spread the #WontBeErased campaign to her Twitter followers. In January 2019, during one of her Enigma shows, she criticized Vice President Mike Pence for his wife Karen Pence working at an evangelical Christian school where LGBTQ people are turned away, calling him ""the worst representation of what it means to be a Christian"". Gaga also stated: ""I am a Christian woman, and what I do know about Christianity is that we bear no prejudice, and everybody is welcome"". Gaga made a congratulatory speech commemorating the 50th anniversary of the Stonewall riots and the LGBTQ community's accomplishments at WorldPride NYC 2019 outside the Stonewall Inn, birthplace of the modern gay rights movement.

Lady Gaga,singer,== Legacy ==
Lady Gaga,singer,"Gaga was named the ""Queen of Pop"" in a 2011 ranking by Rolling Stone based on record sales and social media metrics. In 2012, she ranked fourth in VH1's Greatest Women in Music, and became a feature of the temporary exhibition The Elevated. From the Pharaoh to Lady Gaga, which marked the 150th anniversary of the National Museum in Warsaw."
Lady Gaga,singer,"Gaga has often been praised for using controversy to bring attention to various issues. According to Frankie Graddon of The Independent, Gaga—who wore a meat dress to highlight her distaste for the US military's ""don't ask, don't tell"" policy—influenced protest dressing on red carpet. Billboard named her ""the Greatest Pop Star of 2009"", asserting that ""to say that her one-year rise from rookie to MVP was meteoric doesn't quite cut it, as she wasn't just successful, but game-changing—thanks to her voracious appetite for reinvention."" Because of The Fame's success—it was listed as one of the 100 Greatest Debut Albums of All-Time by Rolling Stone in 2013—Gaga has been credited as one of the musicians that popularized synth-pop in the late 2000s and early 2010s."
Lady Gaga,singer,"According to Kelefa Sanneh of The New Yorker, ""Lady Gaga blazed a trail for truculent pop stars by treating her own celebrity as an evolving art project."" Including Born This Way as one of the 50 best female albums of all time, Rolling Stone's Rob Sheffield considers it ""hard to remember a world where we didn't have Gaga, although we're pretty sure it was a lot more boring"". In 2015, Time noted that Gaga had ""practically invented the current era of pop music as spectacle"". A decade later, Daniel D'Addario of Variety further observed the influence of Gaga's sense of spectacle on the next generation of artists, calling her ""a pop star's pop star"". He surmised that Sabrina Carpenter's use of self-parodying and ultra-glam camp in her performances, Billie Eilish's incorporation of grandeur into her shows, and Chappell Roan's ""drag-inflected let's-put-on-a-show spirit"" and ""eagerness to use costumes and makeup to help tell her stories"" all came from each watching the video for ""Bad Romance"" in their childhood."
Lady Gaga,singer,"A 2017 journal published by Psychology of Aesthetics, Creativity, and the Arts studying structural patterns in melodies of earworm songs compiled lists of catchiest tracks from 3,000 participants, in which Gaga's ""Bad Romance"", ""Alejandro"", and ""Poker Face"" ranked number one, eight, and nine, respectively.

Taylor Swift,singer,"Swift signed to Big Machine Records in 2005, debuting as a country singer with the albums Taylor Swift (2006) and Fearless (2008). The singles ""Teardrops on My Guitar"", ""Love Story"", and ""You Belong with Me"" found crossover success on country and pop radio formats. She incorporated rock on Speak Now (2010) and electronic on Red (2012), later re-calibrating her image from country to pop with the synth-pop set 1989 (2014); the ensuing media scrutiny inspired the hip-hop-imbued Reputation (2017). The albums contained the Billboard Hot 100 number-one singles ""We Are Never Ever Getting Back Together"", ""Shake It Off"", ""Blank Space"", ""Bad Blood"" and ""Look What You Made Me Do""."
Taylor Swift,singer,"Shifting to Republic Records in 2018, Swift released the electropop album Lover (2019) and explored indie folk styles in the 2020 albums Folklore and Evermore. She experimented with subdued pop genres on Midnights (2022) and The Tortured Poets Department (2024), and began re-recording her Big Machine albums as Taylor's Version due to an ownership dispute with the label. Through the 2020s, she garnered the US number one songs ""Cardigan"", ""Willow"", ""All Too Well"", ""Anti-Hero"", ""Cruel Summer"", ""Is It Over Now?"", and ""Fortnight"". She has undertaken six concert tours, including the Eras Tour (2023–2024), the highest-grossing tour of all time.

Taylor Swift,singer,== Early life ==
Taylor Swift,singer,"Taylor Alison Swift was born on December 13, 1989, in West Reading, Pennsylvania. She is named after the singer-songwriter James Taylor. Her father, Scott Kingsley Swift, was a stockbroker for Merrill Lynch, and her mother, Andrea Gardner Swift (née Finlay), worked as a mutual fund marketing executive. Swift's younger brother, Austin, is an actor. Their maternal grandmother, Marjorie Finlay (née Moehlenkamp), was an opera singer, whose singing in church became one of Swift's earliest memories of music that shaped her career. Swift is of Scottish, English, and German descent, with distant Italian and Irish ancestry."
Taylor Swift,singer,"Swift spent her early years on a Christmas tree farm in Pennsylvania that her father had purchased from one of his clients, and she spent her summers at her family's vacation home in Stone Harbor, New Jersey, where she occasionally performed acoustic songs at a local coffee shop. She is Christian and attended preschool and kindergarten at a Montessori school run by the Bernardine Sisters of St. Francis before transferring to the Wyndcroft School. When her family moved to Wyomissing, she attended Wyomissing Area Junior/Senior High School. As a child, she performed in Berks Youth Theatre Academy productions and traveled regularly to New York City for vocal and acting lessons. Her early love for country music was influenced by Shania Twain, Patsy Cline, LeAnn Rimes, and the Dixie Chicks, and she spent weekends performing at local festivals and events. After watching a documentary about Faith Hill, she became determined to pursue a country music career in Nashville, Tennessee."
Taylor Swift,singer,"At 11, Swift traveled to Nashville with her mother to visit record labels and submit demo tapes of Dolly Parton and Dixie Chicks karaoke covers. She was rejected by all the labels, which led her to focus on songwriting. She started learning the guitar at 12 with the help of Ronnie Cremer, a computer repairman and local musician who also assisted Swift with writing an original song. In 2003, Swift and her parents started working with the talent manager Dan Dymtrow. With his help, Swift modeled for Abercrombie & Fitch and had an original song included on a Maybelline compilation CD. After performing original songs at an RCA Records showcase, 13-year-old Swift was given an artist development deal and began to travel regularly to Nashville with her mother. To help Swift break into the country music scene, her father transferred to Merrill Lynch's Nashville office when she was 14 years old, and the family relocated to Hendersonville, Tennessee. Swift attended Hendersonville High School before transferring to Aaron Academy after two years, which better accommodated her touring schedule through homeschooling. She graduated one year early."
Taylor Swift,singer,== Career ==
Taylor Swift,singer,=== 2004–2008: Career beginnings and first album ===
Taylor Swift,singer,"In Nashville, Swift worked with experienced Music Row songwriters such as Troy Verges, Brett Beavers, Brett James, Mac McAnally, and the Warren Brothers and formed a lasting working relationship with Liz Rose. They began meeting for two-hour writing sessions every Tuesday afternoon after school. Rose called the sessions ""some of the easiest I've ever done. Basically, I was just her editor. She'd write about what happened in school that day. She had such a clear vision of what she was trying to say. And she'd come in with the most incredible hooks."" At 14, Swift became the youngest artist signed by Sony/ATV Tree Music Publishing. She left RCA Records due to the label's lack of care and them ""cut[ting] other people's stuff"". She was also concerned that development deals can shelve artists and recalled: ""I genuinely felt that I was running out of time. I wanted to capture these years of my life on an album while they still represented what I was going through."""
Taylor Swift,singer,"At an industry showcase at Nashville's Bluebird Cafe in 2005, Swift caught the attention of Scott Borchetta, a DreamWorks Records executive who was preparing to form an independent record label, Big Machine Records. She had first met Borchetta in 2004. She was one of Big Machine's first signings, and her father purchased a three-percent stake in the company for an estimated $120,000. She began working on her eponymous debut album with Nathan Chapman. Swift wrote or co-wrote all album tracks, and co-writers included Rose, Robert Ellis Orrall, Brian Maher, and Angelo Petraglia. Released in October 2006, Taylor Swift peaked at number five on the US Billboard 200, on which it spent 157 weeks—the longest stay on the chart by any release in the US in the 2000s decade. Swift became the first female country music artist to write or co-write every track on a platinum-certified debut album."
Taylor Swift,singer,"Big Machine Records was still in its infancy during the June 2006 release of the lead single, ""Tim McGraw"", which Swift and her mother helped promote by packaging and sending copies of the CD single to country radio stations. She spent much of 2006 promoting Taylor Swift with a radio tour and television appearances; she opened for Rascal Flatts on select dates during their 2006 tour, as a replacement for Eric Church. Borchetta said that although record industry peers initially disapproved of his signing a 15-year-old singer-songwriter, Swift tapped into a previously unknown market—teenage girls who listen to country music."
Taylor Swift,singer,"Following ""Tim McGraw"", four more singles were released throughout 2007 and 2008: ""Teardrops on My Guitar"", ""Our Song"", ""Picture to Burn"", and ""Should've Said No"". All appeared on Billboard's Hot Country Songs, with ""Our Song"" and ""Should've Said No"" reaching number one. ""Our Song"" made Swift the youngest person to single-handedly write and sing a Hot Country Songs number-one single, and ""Teardrops on My Guitar"" was Swift's breakthrough single on mainstream radio and charts. Swift released two EPs, The Taylor Swift Holiday Collection in October 2007 and Beautiful Eyes in July 2008. She promoted her debut album extensively as the opening act for other country musicians' tours in 2006 and 2007, including those by George Strait, Brad Paisley, and Tim McGraw and Faith Hill."
Taylor Swift,singer,"Swift won multiple accolades for Taylor Swift. She was one of the recipients of the Nashville Songwriters Association's Songwriter/Artist of the Year in 2007, becoming the youngest person given the title. She also won the Country Music Association's Horizon Award for Best New Artist, the Academy of Country Music Awards' Top New Female Vocalist, and the American Music Awards' Favorite Country Female Artist honor.

Swift criticized West and said she never consented to the lyric, but West claimed that he had received her approval and his then-wife Kim Kardashian released video clips of Swift and West discussing the song amicably over the phone. The controversy made Swift a subject of an online ""cancel"" movement. In late 2016, after briefly dating Tom Hiddleston, Swift began a six-year relationship with Joe Alwyn and retreated herself from the public spotlight."
Taylor Swift,singer,"In August 2017, Swift successfully countersued David Mueller, a former radio jockey for KYGO-FM, who sued her for damages from loss of employment.

The album incorporates a restrained electropop and synth-pop sound with elements of hip hop, R&B, and electronica. In the US, Midnights was her fifth to open atop the Billboard 200 with first-week sales of over one million copies, and its tracks, led by the single ""Anti-Hero"", made Swift the first artist to monopolize the top 10 of the Hot 100. Globally, the album broke the record for the most single-day streams and most single-week streams on Spotify and peaked atop the charts of at least 14 countries. The album's two further singles, ""Lavender Haze"" and ""Karma"", both peaked at number two on the Billboard Hot 100."
Taylor Swift,singer,"According to Billboard, Swift was the top-earning solo artist in the US and the top-earning musician worldwide of 2021. She won six American Music Awards including Artist of the Year in 2022. At the MTV Video Music Awards, Swift won her third and fourth trophies for Video of the Year with All Too Well: The Short Film, her self-directed short film that accompanies ""All Too Well (10 Minute Version)"", in 2022 and ""Anti-Hero"" in 2023. During this period, Swift won three Grammy Awards: Best Music Video for All Too Well: The Short Film and Best Pop Vocal Album and Album of the Year for Midnights. Swift became the first artist to win Album of the Year four times in Grammy history."
Taylor Swift,singer,"Swift's next two re-recorded albums, Speak Now (Taylor's Version) and 1989 (Taylor's Version), were released in July and October 2023. The former made Swift the woman with the most number-one albums (12) in Billboard 200 history, surpassing Barbra Streisand, and the latter was her sixth album to sell one million copies in a single week in the US, claiming her career's largest album sales week. 1989 (Taylor's Version)'s single ""Is It Over Now?"" peaked at number one on the Billboard Hot 100. Swift featured on Big Red Machine's ""Renegade"" and ""Birch"" (2021), Haim's ""Gasoline"" (2021), Ed Sheeran's ""The Joker and the Queen"" (2022), and the National's ""The Alcott"" (2023). For the soundtrack of the film Where the Crawdads Sing (2022), she wrote and recorded ""Carolina"", which received nominations for Best Original Song at the Golden Globes and Best Song Written for Visual Media at the Grammy Awards. Besides music, Swift had a supporting role in the period comedy film Amsterdam (2022)."
Taylor Swift,singer,"In 2023, Swift was the most streamed artist on Spotify, Apple Music, and Amazon Music; and the first act to place number one on the year-end Billboard top artists list in three different decades (2009, 2015 and 2023). She had five out of the 10 best-selling albums of 2023 in the US, a record since Luminate began tracking US music sales in 1991."
Taylor Swift,singer,=== 2023–present: The Eras Tour and The Tortured Poets Department ===
Taylor Swift,singer,"In March 2023, Swift embarked on the Eras Tour, a retrospective tour covering all her studio albums. Media outlets extensively covered the tour's global cultural and economic impact, and its US leg broke the record for the most tickets sold in a day. Ticketmaster received public and political criticisms for mishandling the tour's ticket sales. The Eras Tour became the highest-grossing tour in history. Its concert film, released to theaters worldwide on October 13, 2023, grossed over $250 million to become the highest-grossing concert film and was nominated for the Golden Globe Award for Cinematic and Box Office Achievement. A photobook, The Official Taylor Swift: The Eras Tour Book, was released on November 29, 2024, and sold over a million copies in its first week in the US alone."
Taylor Swift,singer,"Swift's eleventh studio album, The Tortured Poets Department, was released on April 19, 2024. Topping charts globally, the album broke a string of records: it marked the first album ever to amass 1 billion Spotify streams in a week; sold 2.6 million units in its first week in the US; made Swift the first artist to monopolize the top 14 of the Billboard Hot 100 and the top 10 of Australia's ARIA Singles Chart; and went on to spend 17 weeks atop the Billboard 200—Swift's longest-running number-one album on the chart. The lead single, ""Fortnight"", featuring Post Malone, became Swift's 12th number one song on the Hot 100."
Taylor Swift,singer,"After the pandemic, Swift's music releases, touring, and related activities culminated in an unprecedented height of popularity. From 2023 onward, Swift found ubiquitous success, albeit more dominant than before, with the successes of the re-recordings, the Eras Tour, its concert film, Midnights, and The Tortured Poets Department, significantly increasing her net worth; Music Business Worldwide remarked this as a ""new stratosphere of global career success"" for Swift. In 2023, she began dating the American football player Travis Kelce, and in 2024, won Artist of the Year at the 2024 iHeartRadio Music Awards. Swift was Spotify's most streamed artist once again in 2024. "
Taylor Swift,singer,"In January 2024, AI-generated fake pornographic images portraying Swift were posted to Twitter and spread to other social media platforms, spurring criticism and demands for legal reform. In July, Swift and Kelce received death threats from a stalker in Gelsenkirchen, Germany, and three children were killed in a stabbing attack at a Swift-themed workshop in Southport, England, leading to civil unrest in the UK. In August, all three of the Eras Tour concerts in Vienna were canceled following the arrest of two suspects for allegedly planning an Islamic State-inspired terrorist attack in the city. The plan was uncovered by US intelligence and was thwarted by Austrian police forces."
Taylor Swift,singer,== Artistry ==
Taylor Swift,singer,=== Musical styles ===
Taylor Swift,singer,"Swift has ventured into diverse genres throughout her career, including pop, country, folk, rock, and alternative music. Her early musical influences were 1990s female country musicians such as Shania Twain, Faith Hill, LeAnn Rimes, and the Dixie Chicks, and Keith Urban's country crossover sounds incorporating rock, pop, and blues. She self-identified as a country musician and achieved prominence as a country pop singer with her first four studio albums, from Taylor Swift to Red. The albums feature country signifiers such as banjo, six-string banjo, mandolin, fiddle, and a slight vocal twang, in addition to pop melodies and rock influences; Speak Now draws on rock styles such as pop rock, pop-punk, and 1980s arena rock. Critics argued that country was an indicator of Swift's narrative songwriting rather than musical direction and accused her of causing mainstream country music to stray from its roots."
Taylor Swift,singer,"After the critical debate around Red's eclectic pop, rock, and electronic styles, Swift chose 1980s synth-pop as a defining sound of her recalibrated pop artistry and image, inspired by the music of Phil Collins, Annie Lennox, Peter Gabriel, and Madonna. 1989, the first album in this direction, incorporates electronic arrangements consisting of dense synthesizers and drum machines. Swift expanded on the electronic production on her next albums; Reputation consists of hip hop, R&B, and EDM influences; and Lover features eclectic elements from country, pop-punk, and folk rock. When Swift embraced a pop identity, rockist critics regarded her move as an erosion of her country music songwriting authenticity, but others regarded it as necessary for Swift's artistic evolution and defended her as a pioneer of poptimism."
Taylor Swift,singer,"Her 2020 alternative albums Folklore and Evermore explore indie styles of rock and folk, and both incorporate a subtle, stripped-back soundscape with orchestration, synthesizers, and drum pads. The latter experiments with varied song structures, asymmetric time signatures, and diverse instruments. Critics deemed the indie styles a mature representation of Swift's artistry as a singer-songwriter. Midnights and The Tortured Poets Department both incorporate a minimalist, subdued synth-pop sound, making use of analog synthesizers, sustained bass notes, and simple drum machine patterns."
Taylor Swift,singer,"With continuous musical reinventions, Swift was described by Time and the BBC as a musical ""chameleon"". Jody Rosen commented that by originating her career in Nashville, Swift made a ""bait-and-switch maneuver, planting roots in loamy country soil, then pivoting to pop"". Clash wrote that she has the versatility to ""no longer [...] be defined by any genre or sound label"". According to Ann Powers, Swift's sound is genre-agnostic, blending and ""reconfiguring"" elements of country, R&B, indie pop, and hip hop."
Taylor Swift,singer,=== Voice ===
Taylor Swift,singer,"Swift possesses a mezzo-soprano vocal range and a generally soft and breathy timbre that Rolling Stone deemed versatile. Reviews of Swift's early country albums criticized her vocals as weak and strained compared to those of other female country singers. Despite the criticism, most reviewers appreciated that Swift refrained from correcting her pitch with Auto-Tune and how she prioritized ""intimacy over power and nuance"" to communicate the messages of her songs with her audience—a style that has been described as conversational. According to Powers, Swift's defining vocal feature was her attention to detail to convey an exact feeling—""the line that slides down like a contented sigh or up like a raised eyebrow""."
Taylor Swift,singer,"On Red and 1989, Swift's vocals are electronically processed to accompany the pop production. Her voice on Reputation and Midnights incorporates hip-hop and R&B influences that result in a near-rap delivery which emphasizes rhythm and cadence over melody. She uses her lower register vocals extensively in ""Cardigan"" and both her lower and upper registers in Evermore; the musicologist Alyssa Barca described her timbre in the upper register as ""breathy and bright"" and the lower register as ""full and dark""."
Taylor Swift,singer,"Reviews in The New York Times, Variety and The Atlantic were more appreciative of Swift's vocals in her later albums. She ranked 102nd on Rolling Stone's 2023 list of the 200 Greatest Singers of All Time: ""A decade ago, including her on this list would have been a controversial move, but recent releases like Folklore, Evermore, and Midnights officially settled the argument."" Laura Snapes of The Guardian said that Swift's ""vocal directness"" enables her to express wide-ranging feelings, highlighting some trademarks such as ""yo-yoing vocal yelp"" and ""climactic, processed cri de coeur"". Amanda Petrusich praised how the clarity and tone of Swift's live vocals accentuate her lyrics."
Taylor Swift,singer,=== Songwriting ===
Taylor Swift,singer,"Swift's fascination with songwriting began in her childhood. She credited her mother with igniting confidence and early songwriting interests by helping her prepare for class presentations. She enjoyed Disney film soundtracks and would make up lyrics once she had run out of words singing them. Her lyrical influences include female country songwriters such as Patsy Cline, Loretta Lynn, Tammy Wynette, and Dolly Parton; 1990s songwriters such as Melissa Etheridge, Sarah McLachlan, and Alanis Morissette; Joni Mitchell; and Fall Out Boy. She listed Paul McCartney, Bruce Springsteen, Emmylou Harris, and Kris Kristofferson as career role models, citing their both evolving and consistent songwriting outputs. Her literary influences include the authors William Shakespeare, Nathaniel Hawthorne, F. Scott Fitzgerald, and the poets William Wordsworth, Robert Frost, and Emily Dickinson; the last of whom was a distant cousin of Swift."
Taylor Swift,singer,"In The New Yorker in 2011, Swift said she identifies as a songwriter first: ""I write songs, and my voice is just a way to get those lyrics across"". Her personal experiences were a common inspiration for her early songs, which helped her navigate life. Her ""diaristic"" technique began with identifying an emotion, followed by a corresponding melody. On her first three studio albums, love, heartbreak, and insecurities, from an adolescent perspective, were dominant themes. She delved into the tumult of toxic relationships on Red, and embraced nostalgia and post-romance positivity on 1989. Reputation was inspired by the downsides of Swift's fame, and Lover detailed her realization of the ""full spectrum of love"". Other themes in Swift's music include family dynamics, friendship, alienation, self-awareness, and tackling vitriol, especially sexism. She often references or draws inspiration from historical events and figures. Neil McCormick, the chief music critic of The Daily Telegraph, opined that Swift is a ""significant vehicle for expressing the inner lives and day-to-day concerns of women of her generation [and younger]""."
Taylor Swift,singer,"Swift's confessional lyrics received positive reviews from critics, who highlighted their vivid details and emotional engagement, which they found uncommon in pop music, although some perceived her as a fragile, juvenile artist, a label she has consistently challenged. Critics also praised her melodic compositions; Rolling Stone described Swift as ""a songwriting savant with an intuitive gift for verse-chorus-bridge architecture"". NPR dubbed Swift ""a master of the vernacular in her lyrics"", remarking that her songs offer emotional engagement because ""the wit and clarity of her arrangements turn them from standard fare to heartfelt disclosures"". Despite the positive reception, The New Yorker stated she was generally portrayed ""more as a skilled technician than as a Dylanesque visionary"". Tabloid media often speculated and linked the subjects of her songs with her ex-lovers, a practice reviewers and Swift herself criticized as sexist. Aside from clues in album liner notes, Swift avoided talking about the subjects of her songs."
Taylor Swift,singer,"On her 2020 albums Folklore and Evermore, Swift was inspired by escapism and romanticism to explore fictional narratives. She imposed emotions onto imagined characters and story arcs, which liberated her from tabloid attention and suggested new paths for her artistry. Swift explained that she welcomed the new songwriting direction after she stopped worrying about commercial success. According to Spin, she explored complex emotions with ""precision and devastation"" on Evermore. Consequence stated her 2020 albums convinced skeptics of her songwriting prowess, noting her transformation from ""teenage wunderkind to a confident and careful adult""."
Taylor Swift,singer,"Swift divides her writing into three types: ""quill lyrics"", songs rooted in antiquated poeticism; ""fountain pen lyrics"", based on modern and vivid storylines; and ""glitter gel pen lyrics"", which are lively and frivolous. Fans noticed that the fifth track of every Swift album was the most emotionally vulnerable of the album. Awarding her with the Songwriter Icon Award in 2021, the National Music Publishers' Association remarked that ""no one is more influential when it comes to writing music today"". The Week deemed her the foremost female songwriter of modern times, and the Nashville Songwriters Association International named her Songwriter-Artist of the Decade in 2022. Swift has also published two original poems: ""Why She Disappeared"" and ""If You're Anything Like Me""."
Taylor Swift,singer,"Critics have analyzed the distinctive qualities and thematic depth in Swift's songwriting. Critic Kitty Empire opined in 2024 that Swift is ""a profoundly old-fashioned artist"", whose songs ""tell a story, in succinct, emotive ways that often scan meticulously"" unlike most pop music of the time; Empire attributed it to Swift's country beginnings. Swift's bridges are often noted as one of the best aspects of her songs, earning her the title ""Queen of Bridges"" from Time. Mojo dubbed her ""a sharp narrator with a gift for the extended metaphor"". Academics have variably described her as a poet laureate, philosopher, and bard."
Taylor Swift,singer,=== Performances ===
Taylor Swift,singer,"Swift commands large audiences on stage, captivating them through emotional storytelling and vocal delivery rather than relying on elaborate dance choreography. According to V magazine's Greg Krelenstein, she possesses ""a rare gift of turning a stadium spectacle into an intimate setting"", irrespective of whether she is ""plucking a guitar or leading an army of dancers"". In a 2008 review of Swift's early performances, Sasha Frere-Jones of The New Yorker called Swift a ""preternaturally skilled"" entertainer with a vibrant stage presence, adding ""she returned the crowd's energy with the professionalism she has shown since the age of fourteen."" In 2023, Adrian Horton of The Guardian noted her ""seemingly endless stamina"" on the Eras Tour, and i critic Ilana Kaplan called her showmanship ""unparalleled""."
Taylor Swift,singer,"Swift's concert productions have been characterized by elaborate Broadway theatricality and high technology, and her performances frequently incorporate a live band, with whom she has played and toured since 2007. Swift also often accompanies herself with musical instruments such as electric guitar; acoustic guitar; piano; and sometimes twelve-string guitar, six-string banjo, or ukulele. Interacting frequently with the audience, her solo acoustic performances are considered intimate and emotionally resonant, complementing her story-based lyrics and fan connection. Lydia Burgham of The Spinoff opined that this intimacy remains ""integral to her singer-songwriter origins"". Chris Willman of Variety called Swift ""pop's most approachable superstar"", and the 21st century's most popular performer."
Taylor Swift,singer,=== Video and film ===
Taylor Swift,singer,"Swift emphasizes visuals as a key creative component of her music-making process. She has collaborated with different directors to produce her music videos, and over time, she has become more involved with writing and directing. She developed the concept and treatment for ""Mean"" in 2011 and co-directed the music video for ""Mine"" with Roman White the year before. In an interview, White said that Swift ""was keenly involved in writing the treatment, casting and wardrobe. And she stayed for both the 15-hour shooting days, even when she wasn't in the scenes."""
Taylor Swift,singer,"From 2014 to 2018, Swift collaborated with director Joseph Kahn on eight music videos—four each from her albums 1989 and Reputation. Kahn has praised Swift's involvement. She worked with American Express for the ""Blank Space"" music video (which Kahn directed) and served as an executive producer for the interactive app AMEX Unstaged: Taylor Swift Experience, for which she won a Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Interactive Program in 2015. Swift produced the music video for ""Bad Blood"" and won a Grammy Award for Best Music Video in 2016."
Taylor Swift,singer,"Her production company, Taylor Swift Productions, is credited with producing all of her visual media, starting with the 2018 concert documentary Reputation Stadium Tour. She continued to co-direct music videos for the Lover singles ""Me!"" with Dave Meyers, and ""You Need to Calm Down"" (also serving as a co-executive producer) and ""Lover"" with Drew Kirsch, but first ventured into sole direction with the video for ""The Man"" (which won her the MTV Video Music Award for Best Direction). After Folklore: The Long Pond Studio Sessions, Swift debuted as a filmmaker with All Too Well: The Short Film, which made her the first artist to win the Grammy Award for Best Music Video as a sole director. Swift has cited Chloé Zhao, Greta Gerwig, Nora Ephron, Guillermo del Toro, John Cassavetes, and Noah Baumbach as filmmaking influences."

Taylor Swift,singer,== Cultural status ==
Taylor Swift,singer,"Swift has been credited with making a profound impact on the music industry, popular culture, and the economy. She dominates cultural conversations, leading some publications to describe her as a cultural ""vitality"" or zeitgeist. Her music, life, and public image are points of attention in global celebrity culture. Initially a teen idol, she has been referred to as a pop icon; publications describe her enormous popularity and longevity as unwitnessed since the 20th century. In 2013, New York magazine's Jody Rosen dubbed Swift the ""world's biggest pop star"" and opined that the trajectory of her stardom has defied established patterns. Rosen added that Swift ""falls between genres, eras, demographics, paradigms, trends"", leaving her contemporaries ""vying for second place"". Critics regard Swift as a rare yet successful combination of the pop star and singer-songwriter archetypes."
Taylor Swift,singer,"Swift's fans are known as Swifties. Billboard noted that only a few artists have achieved her level of chart success, critical acclaim, and fan support. Swift's million-selling albums are considered an anomaly in the streaming-dominated industry following the end of the album era in the 2010s. Economist Alan Krueger described Swift as an ""economic genius""."
Taylor Swift,singer,"Although labeled by the media in her early career as ""America's Sweetheart"" for her girl next door persona, Swift has been called by detractors ""calculated"" and manipulative of her image, a narrative bolstered by her 2016 dispute with West. Critics have also noted that her personal life and career have been subject to intense misogyny and ""slut-shaming"", as well as rampant media scrutiny and tabloid speculation. Swift has also been a victim of numerous house break-ins and stalkers, some of whom were armed."
Taylor Swift,singer,"Swift's private jet use has drawn scrutiny for its carbon emissions. In 2023, a spokesperson for Swift stated that she had purchased more than double the required carbon credits to offset all tour travel and personal flights. In December 2023, Swift's lawyers sent a cease and desist letter to American programmer Jack Sweeney over tracking her private jet, alleging stalking and safety risks; media outlets have reported that the information posted by Sweeney is a synthesis of publicly available data. In February 2024, it was reported that Swift had sold one of her two private jets."
Taylor Swift,singer,=== Legacy ===
Taylor Swift,singer,"Swift helped shape the modern country music scene, having extended her success beyond the Anglosphere, pioneered the use of the internet (Myspace) as a marketing tool, and introduced the genre to a younger generation. Country labels have since become interested in signing young singers who write their own music; her guitar performances contributed to the ""Taylor Swift factor"": a phenomenon to which an upsurge in guitar sales to women, a previously ignored demographic, is attributed."
Taylor Swift,singer,"According to Pitchfork, Swift changed the music landscape with her genre transitions, a discography that accommodates cultural shifts, and Billboard notes her ability to popularize any sound in mainstream music. Lyrically, in being personal and vulnerable in her songs, music journalist Nick Catucci opined Swift helped make space for later singers like Billie Eilish, Ariana Grande, and Halsey to do the same. Scholars have highlighted the literary sensibility and poptimist implications of Swift. She has been credited with legitimizing and popularizing the concept of album ""eras"". Swift is a subject of academic study and scholarly media research. Various educational institutions offer courses on Swift in literary, cultural, and sociopolitical contexts."

The Weeknd,singer,"Abel Makkonen Tesfaye (Amharic: አቤል መኮንን ተስፋዬ; born February 16, 1990), known professionally as the Weeknd, is a Canadian singer-songwriter and actor. His accolades include four Grammy Awards, 20 Billboard Music Awards, 22 Juno Awards, six American Music Awards, three MTV Video Music Awards, a Latin Grammy Award and nominations for an Academy Award and a Primetime Emmy Award."
The Weeknd,singer,"Tesfaye began releasing music anonymously in 2009. After co-founding the record label XO, he released three mixtapes—House of Balloons, Thursday, and Echoes of Silence—in 2011, and gained recognition for his blend of contemporary and alternative R&B, as well as the mystery surrounding his identity. He signed with Republic Records to reissue the mixtapes into the compilation album Trilogy (2012), and release his debut studio album, Kiss Land (2013) the following year. After a string of collaborations and film soundtrack contributions from 2013 and 2014, Tesfaye transitioned from alternative R&B to a pop sound with his second and third studio albums, Beauty Behind the Madness (2015) and Starboy (2016), both of which debuted atop the US Billboard 200, spawning the US Billboard Hot 100 number-one singles ""Can't Feel My Face"", ""The Hills"", ""Starboy"", and ""Die for You"" (the latter following a remix with American singer Ariana Grande)."
The Weeknd,singer,"He returned to alternative R&B for his debut extended play, My Dear Melancholy (2018), which included the US top-ten single ""Call Out My Name"". He explored the dream-pop and new wave genres with his fourth studio album, After Hours (2020), which spawned the chart-topping singles ""Heartless"", ""Save Your Tears"" (also a remix with Ariana Grande), as well as ""Blinding Lights"", which became the best-performing song in the Billboard Hot 100's history and the longest-charting song at the time. Tesfaye began exploring dance-pop, leading to his fifth album, Dawn FM (2022), which included the US top-ten  single, ""Take My Breath"". In 2023, he co-created and starred in the HBO drama series The Idol, which was a critical failure, while its accompanying soundtrack saw commercial success. His sixth album, Hurry Up Tomorrow (2025), yielded the US top-five single, ""Timeless""."
The Weeknd,singer,"Tesfaye has sold over 75 million records, making him one of the world's best-selling artists. He has earned seven diamond-certifications from the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA) for his singles, and is the first artist to simultaneously hold the top three spots on the Hot R&B/Hip-Hop Songs chart. He has also set the record for most songs to have over 1 billion streams on Spotify (27), with ""Blinding Lights"" being the most-streamed song in the app's history. Tesfaye was listed by Time as one of the world's most influential people in 2020, and was dubbed the ""world's most popular artist"" by Guinness World Records in 2023. An advocate for racial equality and food security, he was appointed a World Food Programme goodwill ambassador in 2021. He has donated millions to causes related to racial equality, food security, and disaster relief, including substantial contributions to COVID-19 relief efforts and the Ethiopian humanitarian crisis."
The Weeknd,singer,== Life and career ==
The Weeknd,singer,=== Early life ===
The Weeknd,singer,"Abel Makkonen Tesfaye was born on February 16, 1990, in Toronto, Ontario, Canada. The only child of Ethiopian immigrants Makkonen Tesfaye and Samrawit Hailu, who separated shortly after his birth, he was raised in the suburb of Scarborough by his mother and grandmother. Tesfaye's patronymic is spelled ""Makkonen"" instead of the traditional Ethiopian name ""Makonnen"". The similarity with the Finnish surname Makkonen is pure coincidence. The spelling of Tesfaye's patronymic might be the result of a typographic error or a new form of the traditional name. Tesfaye is proficient in Amharic, his native language acquired from his grandmother, and is also fluent in French, as he attended a French immersion school. He was further educated at West Hill Collegiate Institute and Birchmount Park Collegiate Institute."
The Weeknd,singer,"At seventeen, Tesfaye dropped out of school and relocated to an apartment in the neighbourhood of Parkdale with two friends, one of whom is La Mar Taylor—his best friend and now creative director. Living a hedonistic lifestyle with his friends, Tesfaye adopted his stage name because he left home on a weekend. He removed the last 'e' in 'weekend' to avoid trademark issues with the Canadian pop rock band the Weekend. He has also experienced homelessness and was incarcerated on several occasions during this time, which encouraged him to ""smarten up, to focus"". During this time, Tesfaye frequently engaged in drug use, including substances such as ketamine, cocaine, MDMA, magic mushrooms, and cough syrup, stating that drugs were a ""crutch"" for him when he wrote music. Before releasing music under his current stage name, he went under the alias ""Kin Kane"", as part of a hip-hop duo called ""Bulleez n Nerdz"", and was part of a production team called 'the Noise'."
The Weeknd,singer,=== 2009–2014: Trilogy and Kiss Land ===
The Weeknd,singer,"In August 2009, Tesfaye began anonymously releasing music on YouTube. The following year, he met the producer Jeremy Rose at a party. Rose asked Tesfaye if he wanted to work together as a dark R&B project after hearing him freestyle over an instrumental. After creating multiple songs and parting ways due to creative differences, Tesfaye was allowed to use the songs they made together under the condition that Rose received production credits. In December 2010, Tesfaye uploaded ""What You Need"", ""Loft Music"" and ""The Morning"" to YouTube under the username ""xoxxxoooxo"". His identity remained undisclosed initially. These songs gained attention online and were later acknowledged in a blog post by the rapper Drake. The songs subsequently received coverage from various media outlets, including Pitchfork and The New York Times."
The Weeknd,singer,"In 2011, Tesfaye met music executives Wassim ""Sal"" Slaiby and Amir ""Cash"" Esmailian, with whom, along with Taylor, he founded the XO record label. On March 21, Tesfaye released his debut mixtape, House of Balloons, which featured production from Illangelo and Doc McKinney.

House of Balloons was named as one of the ten shortlisted nominees for the 2011 Polaris Music Prize."

In May 2023, the Weeknd stated that he was intending to retire the moniker of ""the Weeknd"" in favor of performing under his birth name, or adopting a new pseudonym altogether. He explained that his upcoming album would most likely serve as his ""final hurrah"" under the name."
The Weeknd,singer,=== 2023–present: The Idol and Hurry Up Tomorrow ===
The Weeknd,singer,"The Weeknd co-created the HBO drama series The Idol with Sam Levinson, and stars in the show alongside Lily-Rose Depp. The series premiered at the 2023 Cannes Film Festival out of competition, where it received significant controversy for its graphic depiction of onscreen nudity and sexual content. The series debuted to widespread negative reviews from critics. The Hollywood Reporter stated that the series confirms the allegations that ""Instead of subtly skewering the misogynistic and predatory nature of the business, The Idol became a forbidden love story — the stuff of a toxic man's fantasy"", and called it ""regressive rather than transgressive"". He received negative reviews for his acting, with critic Robert Daniels of The Playlist writing, ""Tesfaye is also a terrible actor. He lacks the comfortability, the gravitas, charisma, and charm to increase the viability of Jocelyn being attracted to him. In most scenes, Tesfaye either hides under the cover of dim lighting, obtrusive coverage, or re-recorded dialogue dubbed into several scenes."" On August 28, 2023, HBO announced it had cancelled The Idol after one season."
The Weeknd,singer,"On June 8, 2023, the Weeknd announced a series of EPs featuring music from The Idol. Originally intended as a soundtrack album, each EP was released following the premiere of each episode of the show, which featured collaborations with Future, Playboi Carti, Madonna, Lil Baby, Lily-Rose Depp, and Jennie from the South Korean girl group Blackpink. Later in June he received an invitation from the Academy to become a member."
The Weeknd,singer,"On July 21, Tesfaye appeared on Travis Scott's lead single ""K-pop"" from his fourth studio album Utopia, and later appeared on another track on Scott's album, ""Circus Maximus"". Tesfaye appeared on Diddy's single ""Another One of Me"" on September 15, which he called his ""final feature"", despite releasing multiple collaborations with Metro Boomin and Future in 2024."
The Weeknd,singer,"On December 2, 2023, Fortnite announced that the Weeknd would be featured as the headlining artist for its Fortnite Festival gamemode and outfits of him would become available to play with on December 9. His outfits have three different variants of himself; the red suit seen throughout the promotional material for After Hours, the outfit from his 2022 Coachella performance, and two of the costumes that he was seen wearing during the After Hours til Dawn Tour."
The Weeknd,singer,"Tesfaye first teased news of a follow-up album to Dawn FM in 2022, telling his fans: ""[I] wonder... did you know you're experiencing a new trilogy?"" via Twitter. On January 8, 2024, he further teased an upcoming album, posting pictures of his last two albums and a question mark on his social media.

The Weeknd,singer,== Artistry ==
The Weeknd,singer,=== Influences ===
The Weeknd,singer,"Tesfaye cites Michael Jackson, Prince, and R. Kelly as his main musical inspirations. He has attributed Jackson's music as key in spurring him to be a singer, referencing the lyrics to ""Dirty Diana"" as an example. His high-flying vocal style was influenced by Ethiopian singers such as Aster Aweke. He grew up listening to a variety of music genres, including soul, hip hop, funk, indie rock, and post-punk. Tesfaye is heavily influenced by 1980s music, and credits the video game Grand Theft Auto: Vice City (2002) for ""opening my eyes"" to the music of that era. ""I've always had an admiration for the era before I was born"", he said in an interview for Billboard. ""You can hear it as far back as my first mixtape that the '80s – Siouxsie and the Banshees, Cocteau Twins – play such a huge role in my sound."""
The Weeknd,singer,"Tesfaye has named Deftones as one of his influences during the making of House of Balloons, Thursday and Echoes of Silence. He has also cited Lana Del Rey, David Bowie, the Smiths, Bad Brains, Talking Heads, DeBarge, 50 Cent, Wu-Tang Clan, and Eminem as influences and inspirations. When Daft Punk announced their split in 2021, Tesfaye praised them during an interview with Variety, saying: ""Those guys are one of the reasons I make music, so I can't even compare them to other people..."""
The Weeknd,singer,=== Production and songwriting ===
The Weeknd,singer,"Tesfaye's songs are ""built around a fogged, crepuscular production"", and feature slow tempos, rumbling bass, and forlorn echoes. His music incorporates samples that are unconventional in R&B production, including punk, shoegaze, dream pop and alternative rock. Marc Hogan of Spin says that Tesfaye's samples tend ""to draw from rock critic-approved sources, though generally ones that already share elements of his sexual menace"", sampling artists such as Beach House, Siouxsie and the Banshees and Aaliyah. Tesfaye worked mostly with producers Illangelo and Doc McKinney, whom Ian Cohen of Pitchfork credits with developing ""a state-of-the-art R&B template"" with the artist. In concert, Tesfaye reappropriates his digitized productions with a suite-like arena rock aesthetic."
The Weeknd,singer,"His emotional, plaintive lyrics often express feelings of hurt and deal with subject matter such as sex, drugs, and partying; this is seen especially in After Hours and House of Balloons. Hermione Hoby of The Guardian characterizes Tesfaye's songs as ""narcotised-slow jams"" and delineates their message as ""partying is an existential experience, sex is fraught with alienation, and everything registers as unreal and unsettling."" Paul MacInnes of The Guardian stated that he views Tesfaye's three mixtapes as ""a rough trajectory of party, after-party and hangover."" Anupa Mistry of the Toronto Standard observes throughout his mixtapes a ""cast of supine, stoned zombie-women... whose legs willingly part after being plied with substances and who morph into threats only when [he is] coming down and feeling vulnerable."" Tesfaye has stated that by singing vulgar, ignorant lyrics in an elegant, sexy way, he is ""paying homage to R Kelly, and even Prince to a certain extent."""
The Weeknd,singer,=== Voice and music style ===
The Weeknd,singer,"Tesfaye often sings in a falsetto register. J. D. Considine finds his singing's ""tremulous quality"" similar to Michael Jackson, but writes that he eschews Jackson's ""strong basis in the blues"" for a more Arabic-influenced melisma. Tesfaye possesses a wide light-lyric tenor vocal range, which spans over three octaves. His vocal range reaches its extreme low at the bass F (F2), and its peak high at the tenor G♯ (G♯5), with a natural tessitura within the upper fourth octave. Tesfaye often makes use of his head voice to build resonance to belt out strong high notes within the fifth octave. Tesfaye's vocals have a recognizable Ethiopian characteristic. Hannah Giogis of Pitchfork notes that ""his trademark vibrato, the characteristically pained whine that pervades much of Tesfaye's music, draws from a long Ethiopian musical legacy of tortured pining. Imbuing our voices with the shaky pain of loss—romantic or otherwise—is a hallmark of Ethiopian musical tradition. Tesfaye, with his staccato wails and aching nostalgia, is a young, North American addition to a dynasty of melodramatic Ethiopian singers."" In 2023, Rolling Stone ranked the Weeknd at number 110 on its list of the 200 Greatest Singers of All Time."
The Weeknd,singer,"Tesfaye's discography spans pop, R&B, hip hop, dance, alternative and new wave genres. His work is generally categorized as alternative R&B, due to his contributions in broadening the genre's musical palette to incorporate indie and electronic styles. Mistry writes that he ""will be obsequiously praised as the future of R&B music—because Tesfaye is a black singer, not because he's making quantifiable, canonical R&B."" Tesfaye shared his thoughts on the primary label during an interview with Time in 2015, stating: ""Alternative R&B is in my soul. It's not going anywhere. When I put out songs from House of Balloons in 2010, people said I made R&B cool again. I'm assuming that's when the label was created. I feel honored that a good part of today's music is inspired by it, consciously or subconsciously. The only way I could have done that was to be ambitious and grand."" Tesfaye's first three mixtapes; House of Balloons, Thursday and Echoes of Silence, are alternative R&B projects that draw on dream pop, post-punk and trip hop, amongst others. His debut studio album Kiss Land is categorized as R&B and dark wave. His next three albums, Beauty Behind the Madness, Starboy and After Hours, are considered R&B and pop; with Starboy utilizing heavy trap influences, and After Hours drawing on new wave and dream pop influences. Tesfaye's fifth studio album Dawn FM explores dance-pop and synth-pop genres."
The Weeknd,singer,== Controversies ==
The Weeknd,singer,=== Plagiarism allegations ===
The Weeknd,singer,"In December 2015, Tesfaye was sued by Cutting Edge Music, which alleged that the bassline for ""The Hills"" had been taken from a composition featured in the score for the 2013 science fiction film The Machine. One of the producers of the song was alleged to have sent a private Twitter message to Tom Raybould, the composer of the film's score, to tell him about the sample. In September 2018, Tesfaye and Daft Punk were sued for allegedly stealing the rhythm for ""Starboy"" from Ethiopian poet and singer-songwriter Yasminah. Tesfaye denied the allegations."
The Weeknd,singer,"In April 2019, Tesfaye was sued by British trio William Smith, Brian Clover, and Scott McCulloch, who accused Tesfaye of copyright infringement from plagiarising their song ""I Need to Love"" in order to create his song ""A Lonely Night"". They sought $150,000 from Tesfaye and Belly. In August 2019, the lawsuit was dismissed via summary judgment with the option to amend, with the court ruling that they had failed to show that Tesfaye or anyone else involved in making ""A Lonely Night"" had access to their song or that the works were substantially similar. In September 2019, the plaintiffs filed an amended claim based on secondary infringement, which is still in litigation."
The Weeknd,singer,"In February 2020, Tesfaye and Kendrick Lamar were sued by the now-defunct indie band Yeasayer, claiming that ""Pray for Me"" includes an unauthorized sample of their song ""Sunrise"". Later that year, Yeasayer voluntarily dismissed their lawsuit. In September 2021, Tesfaye, Nicolás Jaar, and Frank Dukes were sued for copyright infringement by producers Suniel Fox and Henry Strange, protesting that ""Call Out My Name"" is ""strikingly [or] substantially similar, if not identical"" to their 2015 track ""Vibeking""."
The Weeknd,singer,=== Allegations of homophobic lyrics ===
The Weeknd,singer,"In January 2019, Tesfaye was criticized for some of the lyrics in his and Gesaffelstein's single ""Lost in the Fire"". The second verse of the song, with the lines ""You said you might be into girls, said you're going through a phase / Keeping your heart safe / Well, baby, you can bring a friend / She can ride on top your face / While I fuck you straight"", were accused of being homophobic, fetishizing bisexuality, and perpetuating the falsehood that a person who identifies as being part of the LGBTQ+ community can be ""turned straight"". Tesfaye subtly addressed the controversy in the song ""Snowchild"" from After Hours, with the lines ""Every month another accusation / Only thing I'm phobic of is failing""."
The Weeknd,singer,=== The Idol allegations ===
The Weeknd,singer,"On March 1, 2023, Rolling Stone released a lengthy exposé on the working conditions and set life of the HBO drama series The Idol, a series in which Tesfaye stars, co-created and co-wrote alongside Sam Levinson. The series received significant controversy for its graphic depiction of sexual content, which critics labeled ""torture porn"". The series was originally directed by Amy Seimetz who suddenly ""exited with roughly 80 percent of the six-episode series finished"". The series saw a major creative overhaul, as it was reported that Tesfaye felt the show had too much of a ""female perspective"". Over 14 crew members alleged a toxic work environment with one adding ""What I signed up for was a dark satire of fame and the fame model in the 21st century..."" however, ""It went from satire to the thing it was satirizing."" Sources alleged that Seimetz's approach to the story was scrapped and the show became ""like any rape fantasy that any toxic man would have in the show — and then the woman comes back for more because it makes her music better""."
The Weeknd,singer,"In response to the allegations, Tesfaye mocked the reporting on his Twitter account, posting a clip of the characters in the show discussing the magazine saying, ""Rolling Stone? Aren't they a little irrelevant?"". Tesfaye posted the comment in the caption: ""@Rolling Stone did we upset you?"". Tesfaye's response received widespread criticism. In an interview with Vanity Fair, he continued to dismiss the reporting, saying that logistical difficulties with Seimetz's schedule and production timelines, as well as a desire not to rush his first show, propelled the overhaul."

The Weeknd,singer,== Personal life ==
The Weeknd,singer,"Tesfaye prefers to keep his personal life out of the public eye. In the beginning of his career, he refrained from participating in interviews and instead chose to communicate via Twitter, which he attributed to shyness and insecurities. He prefers to be interviewed only in rare situations. Tesfaye was raised as an Ethiopian Orthodox Christian. When asked whether or not he was still religious, he stated to Variety in 2020, ""I dunno...everything is a test, and if you are religious or spiritual, you have to go through things."""
The Weeknd,singer,"From April 2015 to August 2019, Tesfaye was in an on-again, off-again relationship with American model Bella Hadid. She starred in the music video for his single ""In the Night"" in December 2015. He dated American singer-actress Selena Gomez from January to October 2017. Both of the relationships received widespread media attention, and were the topic of tabloid speculation. Tesfaye has been in a relationship with Saudi-born disc jockey Simi Khadra since February 2022. Publications noticed that unlike his previous romances with Hadid and Gomez, Tesfaye keeps his relationship with Khadra private from the press."
The Weeknd,singer,"Tesfaye's hairstyle, which has been described as one of his most recognizable traits, has been claimed to be partly inspired by American artist Jean-Michel Basquiat. He began growing it out in 2011 and remarked at how easy it was to maintain with ""a hard shampoo every once in a while"". He cut his hair in 2016, prior to the release of Starboy. On social media, Tesfaye typically suffixed his first name with ""xo"", which is often used as an emoticon for hugs and kisses. According to The Guardian's Hermione Hoby, this was his intention, though others believe it was a reference to his recreational use of ecstasy and oxycodone. He later altered the handles on his social media to reflect his stage name in preparation for the release of Starboy. In August 2021, during a cover story with GQ, he described himself as being ""sober lite"", meaning that he has stopped using drugs with the exception of marijuana. He also noted that he drinks alcohol occasionally, stating: ""I'm not a heavy drinker, as much as I used to be. The romance of drinking isn't there."""
