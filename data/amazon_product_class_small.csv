doc02023,book,valid,"Mysterious artifacts are discovered on a ridge where a huge lake once existed, 10,000 years ago, in North Dakota. The technology that is gained from the artifacts threatens to render obsolete much of modern day technology and industries. The government is therefore interested in acquiring the land area, to assist in managing a collapsing stock market, and international problems relating to the discoveries. The interesting angle to this story is this - the land is on Sioux reservation territory, and the Sioux view the matter as an opportunity to strengthen vanishing traditions. They are somewhat divided on the issue, but the consensus is to keep the land. The book's focus is not in resolving mysteries about the artifacts, but instead is on the effects they have on people of all walks of life. Many characters are briefly introduced throughout the story, and many do not have vital roles in it. But each, in my view, serve the purpose of showing all the myriad interests and potential problems that individual views about the artifacts could have on society. I found many characters to be colorful and interesting. The book is soundly written, and the pace is quiet and poetic at times. Many things are not resolved, but I found the story to be a thoughtful exploration of problems, rather than solutions. While I thouroughly enjoyed it, the book is certainly not without some flaws. The major one, for sure, is the abrupt and ridiculous ending. I simply could not fathom it as remotely possible, and so for me it was as though there really wasn't an ending at all. It provided a resolution for the author, but not for the reader. That was disappointing, but I could not discount the rest of the book, which was memorable overall."

doc01775,book,train,"It is a sweltering summer in Newark, New Jersey, 1944, and Bucky Cantor is a young man working as a playground supervisor. Bucky is a kind, brave and upstanding young man who suffers a great deal of guilt throughout this novel. First, his guilt is based around the fact that his absent father was a thief and a petty criminal. Brought up by his loving grandparents, Bucky wants to make the memory of his adored grandfather proud and live up to the aspirations and success of his girlfriend and her family. Bucky also has a sense of shame about not being able to fight in the war as his friends are, he is a young man with excellent health, but poor eyesight. Still, the children at the playground adore and look up to him, and Bucky does his best to keep them safe and entertained during the hot, long, summer days.Tragedy strikes in the form of a polio epidemic, for this is before the days of a vaccine or successful treatment, when polio could mean death, permanent disability, or the horror of an iron lung. What is more, the disease was indiscriminate, hitting emotively mostly at young children. Roth evokes that time and those emotions evocatively, in a small community where nobody knows who (or what) causes the deadly disease and how to avoid it spreading unchecked. Are the playgrounds safe and is Bucky in some way to blame? This novel is narrated by one of the young boys who spent that summer observing events, as the story takes us through a tragic time and it's outcome. Although this is a fairly short novel, there is not a word wasted and it is hard not to be affected by this story of a past time when suspicion and fear raged and a disease caused destruction amongst the children of a community."
doc05445,book,train,"I had this book on my Wish list for months and finally found it at the public library. I read it last week and was glad that it was a library read and not a purchase or gift. The book was mediocre at times and the stories varied in terms of the quality of the narration and writing.The ""Use Me"" short story was by far the most compelling piece in the collection. I was left breathless at the end of that story and I wished that the rest of the stories were as powerful."
doc01287,book,valid,"Unlike the original Rambo, author Craig Thomas has brought his troubled Air Force Nam vet through four stories--this book, a sequel ""Firefox Down"" that continues the journey of Gant's stolen MiG out of Soviet airspace into Scandinavia, ""Winterhawk"" in which Gant uses a MiL chopper that the Israelis stole for the US to rescue a deep cover agent from their Baikonur rocket base, and ""A Different War"" which was never published for US release (I bagged a used copy of that one courtesy of rare book site Alibris). In that one, Gant is called upon to investigate an airline tragedy that ends up having corporate skulduggery at its roots--thus its title. The Gant of the printed page is a bit different from the Gant on the screen--in action roles, Eastwood always plays his characters as laconic and menacing. This Gant is more intense, more of an envelope-pusher. As such, he's a lot like David Morrell's Rambo--you'd never make the connection on the screen."
doc01489,book,valid,"I recently read Hume's famous bookA Treatise of Human Nature(first published in 1738), and I thought I would follow it up by reading Whitehead's famous bookProcess and Reality: An Essay in Cosmology(written for the 1927-28 Gifford Lectures). I doubt that reading Whitehead's book was the best use of my time (I was carried away by my curiosity), so I'll write a little review that may help you decide if it's worth your time.Whitehead says in the book's preface: ""These lectures are based upon a recurrence to that phase of philosophic thought which began with Descartes and ended with Hume."" So this book is basically a mid-1920s critique of 17th- and 18th-century European philosophy. If you are not a scholar of European intellectual history but you are curious about Whitehead's concepts, it might not be the best use of your time to read this book; you might be better served by reading one of the more recent studies of this book, such as Elizabeth Kraus'sThe Metaphysics of Experience: A Companion to Whitehead's Process and Reality(first published in 1979 and reissued in 1998).The conceptual system that Whitehead constructs in this book is a kind of inversion of Spinoza's system. As Whitehead says: ""Also it is close to Spinoza; but Spinoza bases his philosophy upon the monistic substance, of which the actual occasions are inferior modes. The philosophy of organism [Whitehead's name for his conceptual system in this book] inverts this point of view."" As I see it, Spinoza's famous bookEthics(first published in 1677) is a much better book than Whitehead's; I think Spinoza's book is more tightly and carefully constructed, and features more explicit practical implications for how to live one's life (although I really disagree with Spinoza's attitude toward nonhuman animals, and I think that one could easily show how opposite conclusions about how to treat nonhuman animals follow from Spinoza's same basic premises). In comparison, Whitehead's book struck me as more sloppily constructed (in its overall structure) and without much practical consequence.The most innovative part of Whitehead's book, as I see it, was Whitehead's use of what he calls ""non-metrical geometry,"" which was perhaps a proto-mereotopology. In recent years this kind of thinking has been put to good use by philosophers such as Antony Galton and Barry Smith, and computer scientists such as Anthony Cohn and Jochen Renz. Whitehead's use of geometry to repudiate ""the trust in language as an adequate expression of propositions"" was on the right track. With the advent of digital computers, and as our lives become permeated by increasingly sophisticated geographical information systems and other applications of geometry and scientific imaging, the inadequacy of language, and the availability of practical alternatives for dealing with that inadequacy, is ever more apparent.I should note that the Gifford Lectures that immediately preceded and followed this book have also become famous: Eddington'sThe Nature of the Physical World(written for the 1926-27 Gifford Lectures) and Dewey'sThe Quest for Certainty: A Study of the Relation of Knowledge and Action(written for the 1928-29 Gifford Lectures). Another book that dates from the same time period but is, in my view, more cogent than Whitehead's book, is Weyl'sPhilosophy of Mathematics and Natural Science(first published in 1927). If I could only read one of these books from this time period, Whitehead's would probably not be the one I would choose.Dewey's Gifford Lectures, given a year after Whitehead's, contain a statement which is interesting to think about in relation to Whitehead's book: ""Persons having the advantage of positions of leisure and who find pleasure in abstract theorizing--a most delightful indulgence to those to whom it appeals--have a large measure of liability for a cultivated diffusion of ideals and aims that are separated from the conditions which are the means of actualization."""
doc02270,book,valid,"In Denis Johnson's newest novel, the narrator presents a mostly affecting and occasionally comic meditation on loss and the things that still might tie one to life in a universe empty of meaning or permanence.  The theme is  as old as Lucretius, and the narrator's solution is reminiscent of Keats'  line preferring &quot;a life of sensations rather than thoughts&quot;  The  emotionally dead narrator accordingly is brought back to 'life' by sudden  outbursts of anger and a crying jag equally unplanned.  Rather than trying  to figure things out or anticipate the future, he elects to go with the  flow of things inside and outside of himself.  Perhaps fresher, and more  persuasive, are the narrator's paeons to unpremeditated artistic  expression, as in his commendations of a small child's lute playing which  focuses solely and impressively on the truth of the music, not the notes in  themselves; or in the praise of the &quot;harmony&quot; in the singing of a  group of not overly reflective fundamentalists. The strength of this novel  lies chiefly, I think, in the gorgeousness of its phrases.  Johnson refers  to a &quot;banana moon,&quot; &quot;the waterfall noise of a stadium  crowd,&quot; etc. The world of the narrator, one of time and change, has  been set before us with beauties that do not themselves quickly pass away."
doc05414,book,train,"I'm a romance novel addict even at my advanced age, so I've got a lot of books under my ""have read that"" belt.  And I have read just about every romance written by Elizabeth Boyle and each time wonder why I did it.  Doesn't say much for my learning curve, but there's always something about each book that I like and makes me think that the next one will be even better.  The problem for me is that the Boyle heroines have too much 21st-century freedom and are full of modern-day sensibilities and actions. This new young heroine trains spies, is an expert at picking locks, breaking spy codes, cheating at cards, understanding foreign terrain and dealing out a mean uppercut. Not that these are usual activities for a 21st-century woman, but it would be even less likely for a 19th-century female. She is also illegitimate, from the lower classes, and at the end of the book ends up married to an earl. So to enjoy this book, one must suspend logic and just go with the story, enjoying the romance and the fairy-tale ending it is bound to have. I believe a younger reader will enjoy this much more than I did."
doc06690,book,valid,this was a lovely ending to the whole series of annie groves books - despite the fact that she wasnt able to write it herself i do think the author did her proud -  the only problem i did have with it was it went over old ground and reminded you a tad too much of what went on in the other books - seeing you really have to read the whole series for this book to make any sense i didnt see the point  but all in all i really really enjoyed the whole series of following this family through the war.. would recommend it
doc01833,book,train,"this book is based on total hypes. It's sad that so many people nowadays try to change this  nation into communist or socialism ( same role, just different name) not really knowing the truth, just based on some political ideology that human history had repeatedly  proved to be failed.  In fact communism is the worst political system that ever presented on earth.1989, Tinamen square, a million chines college students marched to protest against their communist government of oppression: it was broadcasted all over the world, they were asking communist government to give them ;freedom for speech, media, business, religion, true-democracy( not like few communist party people controlling) by election. Sooner the communist government sent them tanks and guns and indiscriminately shoot them and ran over with tank. Whole world watched through television broadcast.Now some ignorant Americans already forgot about this just 20 years ago's brutality that we watched with our own eyes, want to change this great nation into communist?Because of its brutality, I escaped from that regime. And I  am happy to be in this country where human freedom is mostly respected, and protected. Communist lies saying every one shares equally: In fact only, those few comrades who caused the shift of power enjoy the wealth and power, but the rest of the general citizens have no equality nor basic human right. Any one speak against government---disappear next day to ""concentration camp"" w/o fair trials nor justice. Communist shut down all religious freedom, or freedom of speech ( all medias are government controlled) Communists deny any form of gods but instead, they set the status of Stalin or Ma chiding, or Kimjung ill, and have to sing songs and salute for them, worship them.  From elementary children to elders... Anyone dares to go against the government, ---labor camp!  Several millions who stand  for their freedom were killed brutally  in early 20th century, during the communism overturn. ,Research the communism nations' history. All the nations turned into  communism fall into worst human rights and economic state from their establishment. Any communist countries in the history ever get better as decades go by?China is the only seemingly doing well now. Why? because from 10 years ago, they realized communism was failed with extreme poverty, started to adapting the partial capitalism into their system-free competitive capitalism. That's the reality people. Stalin communist government killed 90 millions including the vicinity nations that were turn into communism, Macho-tong communist killed 100 millions, 2 millions by North Korea, by Cambodia each, 2 millions in Africa, 200,000 latin America..so on . But most of all they all became terribly poor after communist regime,oppressing the free capitalism, except China, because they started to adapt the partial capitalism from 10 years ago after they realized the harsh economic state. Now history tells also other evil regime; Hitler killed 6 million jew with other 4 million of Europeans; Japan' imperialism killed 20 million Asians during WWII, ..so on.Men can't govern themselves. They always proved to be failed again and again throughout the history.If USA turned into communism, the power will shift  to only those who hate the existing American system. They  secretly controlling communicast-medias ( I already see it happened ) and brainwashing the youth with distorted  facts in textbooks  last 20 years. They keep change their names, their activity, and theory. Why? if they openly speak up, they know they will fail because any normal mind people will see the deception and its perversion. Look at these behind scene head members:They are  mostly angry people with extreme hatred. Before you get associate with these kinds, study the actual communism history and the result of those countries over last 100 years.  then you might understand why people escape from those communist countries despite the danger of their lives, come to USA.  Americans seem so ignorant ,  don't even  know what kind of freedom or dreams that anyone can pursue if they want. I can't believe how americans are lazy and stupid (sorry for my expression) not protecting their precious freedom and the wealth that whole world envy. Pretty sad to see this great nation is stumbling by the smooth, deceitful talking,  present government and together with mostly blinded, deceivedmajority. My last word: America wake up and protect what your forefathers gave to you. Don't get robbed by those haters of your wealth and power. If America had been  the most wealthy and liberal nation in the whole world so far, doesn't it already proved what you have is the best national  system already?Do you have to be a rocket scientist to see this simple truth? Don't be deceived"

doc02616,book,valid,"Jim Wallis has produced an important document for Christians considering their place in the political process. Although the content is a bit repetitious of his 2005 book, God's Politics, Wallis makes a strong case that there is a growing Christian revival happening in our politics and that Christian beliefs can no longer be claimed solely by the Republican party. In fact, Wallis sets forward an excellent argument that the issues of abortion, gay marriage and family values that have been championed for so long by the Religious Right are not the only issues on which to judge the morality or beliefs of a candidate or party. Wallis argues that Jesus would want us to look at additional issues such as poverty, global warming, environmental stewardship and a consistent culture of life as we decide who to support. He clearly explains why Christians should be involved in secular culture, yet should never be co-opted by any one political party or organization. In short, he suggests that voters take the time to determine which candidates overall stance on the issues best fits within a system of Christian ethics and beliefs. As an example, candidates who support continuing an unjust war, devaluing life through the accepted use of torture or expanding the death penalty may not be the best choices for a voter who believes in a consistent culture of life as expressed in the teachings of Jesus."
doc08764,book,train,"I just now finished reading the celebrated/notorious ""foie gras"" section; as a Francophilic reseller checking prices for this title, I noticed some of the reviews and got curious.For all I know the large-scale editing could be better (or the book might be intended to stand as chapter-independent), but the 5-6 pages I read were quite well crafted, with varied and sensitive sentence pacing and inclusion of many insightful details.If you can't get from one end of a compound or (perish the thought) complex sentence to the other, like so many young video-game-deranged ADHD cases apparently have trouble doing, this lovely slice of a beautiful if hard way of life will probably be too taxing to enjoy.But for seasoned readers, it's a delectable offering as far as I've seen (and it's fun to handle a book with traditional, ragged page signature edges for a change).Foie gras production seems a pretty inhumane business (although geese do gorge naturally), but non-vegetarians won't be learning anything totally new about how the other half lives.  The people are wonderful and real.  I wish I too could visit the area, as one reviewer said she did, before it becomes part of a bygone age!P.S.

doc08009,book,train,"ncheonette is first and foremost a memoir - the life of young Steven and the ways in which he deals with his father's failing health, which precipitates a major shift in Steven's life.  The story is told with great humor and vividness, bringing us into the life of an Italian family in suburban New Jersey.But more than a story of place, this is a story of coming to terms with what life brings us.  To paraphrase an old phrase, if you are dealt lemons, then make lemonade.  As Luncheonette so adeptly points out, this is easy to do in theory, but a lot more difficult to do in practice.  Steven was lucky in that he had a great role model in his father, but even with this guidance, the road is not an easy one.Luncheonette is a quick read, one that you will not want to put down once you have started it.  It is not a deep book, but its message is very important and relevant to each of us as we face life's changes and challenges."

doc06315,book,valid,"I loved this book so much that I don't even know what to talk about first. Have you ever read a book that was so enjoyable that you didn't want it to end? That's how I felt about Fan Art. It was such an ADORABLE story that was thoroughly entertaining.I loved everything about Jamie. He was beyond cute and adorable, and just so confused. Jamie is gay and is out at home, but not at school, and definitely not to his best friend, Mason. Jamie had to hide the huge crush that he was developing on Mason because he was terrified what the truth will do to their friendship. Jamie was a little clueless and quite naive at times, and he really tried my patience more than once because I wanted him to have the confidence to admit how he was feeling. But I still found myself laughing and groaning and tearing up just a bit as Jamie struggled with coming out to Mason.Jamie had the best parents ever! They were so supportive and encouraged him to be himself. His step father even threw him a coming out party! How cool and utterly awkward is that? And just wait until you read about how he acted around his 2 little sisters. The cuteness might just make you swoon! Jamie also had the best guy and girl friends that anyone could ask for. They were always ready to lend an ear and offer advice, even if Jamie wasn't ready to hear what they had to say. You could tell they really just wanted him to be happy. Of course, what would high school be without a bully? Jamie attracted the attention of one of the meanest homophobes in school who finds joy in going out of his way to make Jamie's life hell.One aspect that I really liked was Jamie working on the school's literary magazine. Because he had a hand in choosing the content, we got to see the students' poems that were submitted, which I especially enjoyed. I also really liked the short story fan art that turned out to be so controversial and spurred Jamie into wanting to take action.I thought the romance was so worth waiting for. Jamie and Mason had been friends for years. They were so comfortable with each other and it was nice to see how well they got along. I could never tell if Mason somehow knew Jamie's secret all along, so it kept me guessing as to how and when things would progress between them.My goodness, the cuteness factor in this book is off the charts! I adored Jamie and Mason because they were SO easy to like. I loved the complexity of their relationship, and how the underlying tension between them made things so awkward at times. Their story was light and heartwarming, a bit clich&eacute; at times, but still very entertaining. I was satisfied with the way the story played out, and even though it was a bit predictable at times, I still loved every second of it! No doubt this book will leave you all warm and fuzzy inside with a big smile on your face. At least it did me!"

Unfortunately, the writing was the problem. The dialogue is too often stilted, the prose is clunky with lines like,'&#34;Damn,&#34; Magda swore aloud.' There is just too much telling and describing, and that ruins the pacing as well as the immersiveness, (may have just made that word up), of the story.I just couldn't get involved enough with Sweeney and her friends, which is a shame because with Moon Goddesses and Benandati and moonlit passion, it seemed they did have quite a story to tell."

There are a lot of plot twists that are slowly revealed, which made me want to read more and find out what happens next.  I didn't want to put this one down, almost right from the start.

doc06251,book,train,"I have been involved in the publishing industry for some time, and I know the worth of the &quot;official&quot; reviews for most major review publications, particularly the anonymous ones.  I hope Sean knows how completely corrupt and worthless the review process is, with the majority of &quot;good&quot; reviews tied to advertising revenue or the lack thereof, or simple desire to scratch each others' backs.  I only say this because while there are some factual errors or a few pieces of information that are exaggerated in DELIVER US FROM EVIL, Sean Hannity does not use &quot;circular logic.&quot;  He may overstate his case (and he does, on several occasions) but he doesn't fail to make his case.Those who have seen The Passion of the Christ (or who've read the original book) can recognize some of the behaviors and attitudes Sean discusses in this book in Pontius Pilate.  Pilate is a &quot;pragmatist&quot; appeaser who destroys his own worth while trying to play each side against the other.  &quot;What is the truth?&quot; Pilate asks his wife.  One doesn't have to be a Catholic (and I am not) to understand the idea that in the absence of good, evil flourishes.A very different person from anyone quoted in Sean's book said that &quot;the second half of the 20th century will be remembered as the one that took us to the moon, then spent the next thirty years languishing in low earth orbit . . . at the core of our risk-free society is a self-indulgent failure of nerve.&quot;  The great astronaut Buzz Aldrin said that.The official &quot;liberal&quot; politicians and what passes for commentators in their environment might be surprised to know of the contempt they've aroused among their own constituents.  I am a college professor, and I work with very diverse classrooms.  Most students after a time, come to realize that I am a Christian, and they might guess I'm pretty conservative too, although my views are never imposed on the classroom, nor are students ever downgraded for their own beliefs and opinions. Just as Sean gives the example of Churchill's statements about the German people (the British were not enemies of the German people, just their leaders), so too it is true that regular &quot;liberal&quot; people are not evil.  But Sean makes a pretty good case that liberal leaders are at least the Pilate type of evil.It is very evil to ignor the truth about the Islamic terrorists. Their evil not only endangers America, but also the great majority of the Islamic world, people who don't believe as they do, and who believe in a great and wonderful religion that's been twisted to serve evil purposes.  There also comes a time when any intelligent person can say that we should learn from the past -- the mistakes of Vietnam, the mistakes of being supportive of and involved in cruel totalitarian regimes over the years, as well as the courage and conviction of Winston Churchill in the face of ultimate evil -- instead of constantly denigrating, downgrading and destroying the esteem that we have as a nation.Right now my students who'd ordinarily be voting as &quot;liberals&quot; are just disgusted by the current group of campaigners and they aren't convinced by statements made by supposed &quot;leaders&quot; like Sen. Kerry -- I turned on the TV the other day and heard him intoning in that death-knell voice, &quot;This Pres-I-Dent is the worst Pres-I-Dent in the last EIGHTEEN PRESIDENTS.&quot;  Well, there's some logic for ya.  That he or anyone would actually think this would &quot;go over&quot; with anyone is beyond comprehension.My grandfather always told me, &quot;Nobody's candle ever burned brighter because they try to snuff somebody else's candle out.&quot;  See, the reason I have to give Sean's book four instead of five stars is that it is very current and topical and I don't think the situation we face today is very different from the situation people have faced throughout history.  I think things are, in general, getting better and not worse.  I don't even take very seriously the idea that the ultra negative campaigning and almost absurdly hysterical accusations that I see on TV could have a positive result.  I heard a little story about former California Governor Gray Davis the other day.  One student had a friend who was a high official on Davis' election team.  In the election prior to the recall, LA Mayor Richard Riordan had been running as a strong candidate.  He was so smeared in the press by Davis' team that he pulled out of the race, leaving a less-qualified candidate, Bill Simon, to run.  Davis beat Simon, and when the student asked his friend, &quot;Isn't Gov. Davis afraid if he's so dirty about other candidates, people will turn against him?&quot;&quot;Davis has $16 million in the bank and he's the incumbent.  He's not worried about anything and he says what he wants.&quot;Well, so much for that wisdom.  Sean Hannity's book is, sad for the people who are putting our country's well being, happiness and future at risk for their own personal gain, pretty true and pretty factual.  I think this book would be very valuable for those who need to be reminded of their history lessons.  The only lesson I'll remind people of is that I was a young woman (who did the CA Reagan Country poster, too . . . yes, a &quot;Young Republican&quot;) and I remember when President Reagan was called &quot;senile,&quot; &quot;insane,&quot; and supposedly crazy enough to set off a nuclear war just for &quot;general purpose.&quot;  Somehow we were supposed to believe that this brilliant, ethical leader was a brain-damaged, yet murderous monster.  I hear the same stuff now about Pres. Bush and it's said by the same people.  I was also reminded by a friend that a similar type of extreme dirty campaigning and rhetoric occurred during the death throes of the Whig party &quot;back in the day.&quot;  It's not that I don't think people should be vigilant -- we should all participate -- but just that, well, I give Sean 4 stars instead of five because not so vigorous a defense is needed.  It's kind of like playing chess against a chimp.  Only with blind luck is the chimp going to score any points, and it's the decision of the person playing him whether he is going to win or lose."
doc06385,book,train,"Blarg. I wrote my &quot;Thief of Time&quot; review under &quot;Sacred Clowns&quot; forgetting which book I was reviewing. So I'll keep this short. Thief of Time is often considered Hillerman's finest work in his Southwestern Mysteries, but I found it less satisfying than &quot;Blessing Way&quot; and &quot;Sacred Clowns.&quot; In brief, Hillerman seemed to lose control of the book about halfway through and fell victim to the lazy writer's prop of killing a character to inject drama into the story. There were just too many deaths in this one and it contributed to a general lack of focus in the later chapters. And, as usual, I cared a great deal less about the Crime and the Criminals than Leaphorn and Chee. Hillerman's crooks and murderers just aren't fleshed out very well. The motivation in this case was an excellent one--but far too psychologically deep to hang on such a paper-thin character.So there. I love reading Hillerman as much as the next man, but I'm not blind to his faults, the most prominent of which is on glaring display here--he has trouble with the resolutions to his stories, creating a deep, layered mystery, and then wrapping it up in an action movie style that just doesn't fit the earlier parts of his book.RstJ"

This added more depth to the story, now I appreciate Dorothy L. Sayers more than Agatha Christie.  Dorothy not only fleshes her characters out better but her side trips into philosophy and psychology make the story that much more interesting.

doc06111,book,train,"After seeing the movie based on this play, I thought that I would like to read the original script.  On one hand, it is hard for reading the script to be as satisfying as seeing a good production.  One thing, however, that you get out of the script is the stage direction and the author's preface.  One elegant phrase described the old woman who Beatrice looks after to earn some money.  In describing the old woman the author observes that ""Time has left her with a whisper of a smile--the smile of a soul half departed.""  In the preface or introduction, author Paul Zindel makes it clear that the world of this play is closely analogous to the one he knew growing up.  His mother was like Beatrice in almost every way--from her host of improbable schemes for making money, to the memories of her father delivering fruit and vegetables from a horse-drawn wagon.Like Beatrice's daughter Tillie, the science-inspired high school student who wins a science fair contest for the study of the effects of gamma rays on man-in-the-moon marigolds, young Zindel must have looked to science for the way out of the chaos of his dysfunctional family.  In time, Zindel would become a science teacher.I was also interested to read that the marigold seeds featured in this play were irradiated by a Cobalt 60 source similar to that used in the research of some of my colleagues.  It was also interesting to me that the Cobalt 60 source mentioned in this play was located at Oak Ridge National Laboratory.  This reminds me that when I was a Freshman in high school in the 1960's, I found an Oak Ridge address for the Atomic Energy Commission (AEC) in a pamphlet on nuclear engineering supplied by the careers course I was taking.  I wrote to the AEC for information on nuclear science and engineering and was very happy to receive half a dozen inspiring booklets on this topic!"

doc01513,book,train,"Mr. Anthony Morehouse had been celebrating the ultimate win of a magnificent pair of matched gray high stepping horses, probably drinking a bit too much yet still on a winning streak.  He had, in his inebriated state, just won  what he thought was a piece of furniture, `The Ladies' Fashionable Cabinet' only to find that it was not a piece of furniture but a woman's magazine.  Thinking to rid himself of the magazine Anthony set out to visit the `spinsterish' niece of the man he'd won it from only to find the most incredibly beautiful woman sitting behind the editors desk that he had ever seen!Not only did he discover that this beauty was his childhood nemesis, Edwina Parrish,  but she still possessed the one thing she'd won from him over 20 years ago that had caused a giant rift between he and his father - a priceless roman head.  Now, with the precious magazine that was for Edwina, a labor of love, they would agree to a wager that could finally, win him back the priceless artifact.  Edwina had almost always been the winner of all their former bets, only this time Anthony knew he could win. What Anthony soon came to realize though, was that what he most wanted to win, was Edwina's heart!This was for me a totally delightful story, filled with intelligent dialog, wit, and charm.  The two protagonists seemed to pick up where they'd left off from years before with most things between them amounting to a wager.  As many more wagers are made throughout the story Anthony plans his seduction.  One of the most sensuous and amusing scenes I have come across in some time was the result of Anthony's taunt to Edwina that she didn't have any idea on how to `please a man'.  My, oh my, oh my!  I took notes on that one!  The reader will find much to enjoy in this book including an amusing and colorful blend of secondary characters adding wit and wisdom to the storyline.  This was just a totally satisfying read - one I sincerely hope you get a chance to read for yourself."
doc08775,book,train,"Many years before Brazzaville Beach was ever published, William Blake published this well-known poem as part of his Songs of Experience:  ""Tyger, tyger burning bright/ In the forests of the night;/What immortal hand or eye/ Could flame thy fearful symmetry?""  Blake, who was overwhelmed by the beauty and horrors of the natural world, saw nature as a place for our own growth, in preparation for the beginning of our lives.Why the longish preface about Blake?  Brazzaville Beach is, to some degree, about tasting the fruits of knowledge and losing one's innocence.  The main character, Hope Clearwater, will hear these words later on: ""...the pursuit of knowledge is the road to hell...You think that if you know everything you can escape from the world.""There are two Hopes in this book;  the long ago Hope who lived in England (written in third person) and the more current Hope, who lived within an African country (written in the immediate first person).  Both Hopes are quite literally dashed as elusive and forbidden knowledge are pursued.Here's the plot in a nutshell:  Hope, a brilliant scientist in her own right, marries a mercurial and highly intellectual mathematician, who increasingly begins to go insane as he pursues an elusive game theory on turbulence.  Intertwined with that story is the African Hope, who goes to work for another brilliant man named Mallabar, who is about to publish a renowned book on the peaceful chimps.  Her observations belie his premise;  the chimps are cannibalizing each other.  Yet Mallabar will not even entertain that idea;  he, too, is losing it as he holds on to the tendrils of knowledge that he has accumulated.And Hope?  Will she, too, be destroyed as she pursues knowledge or will Hope endure?  That is the question that is at the core of this very clever book.William Boyd, in my opinion, is a brilliant writer who keeps getting better and better and this is one of his earlier books (published in 1990).  As an allegory, it works beautifully.  There are, however, some perceived flaws.For one thing, I never ""bought"" that a woman of Hope's brilliance, single-mindedness and beauty would be attracted to her husband, John Clearwater.  His character is somewhat underdeveloped; certainly, the attraction is not amply explored.  Admittedly, I am not a ""math person"", but the many explorations of game theory, turbulance, catastrophe theory, divergence syndromes and other chaos theory components sometimes left me shaking my head.  They seemed just a little too clever.Secondly, there is a long subsection about the African freedom fighters and Hope's unwilling adventure with them.  As a reader, I get it:  the brutish fighting among various human forces equates to the dissonance among the chimps; guerilla leaders and (a little stretch) gorilla leaders are not all that different. Yet I kept wanting the action to return to the ape colony, which (to me) was more fascinating.Those two caveats aside, I found Brazzaville Beach to be compelling.  Hope reflects about herself:  ""She reshaped the haphazard explicable twists turns of her life into an order that she approved of, where the controlling hand of her authorship could be read clearly, like a signature.""  Ultimately, she is the creator of her own destiny and her fall from Eden is preordained."

Far more of the book is dedicated to the history of Louisiana and slavery itself. I am glad to learn of the uprising as it is something I knew nothing about.

doc05315,book,train,"I didn't!  I found that it proposed a strict set of gender-based rules to follow, which seemed extremely sexist.  These three male authors were well-intentioned and intelligent (although I didn't appreciate them reminding me constantly that they were ""professional men,"" as if to imply that some redneck, beer guzzling lowlife from the trailer park might not have the same expectations for women!)To be fair, Brad, Chris, and Rich are bright guys who were being honest and trying to give women the best advice possible, so that we can eliminate the wrong men from our lives, and cultivate the right ones.  My problem with their advice is that they want women to accept men just the way they are even if that means that women have to play Barbie to get their Ken.To recap some of the tips in this book, women are told not to ask a man out for a first date, not to use profanity initially, not to get too heavy or intense in terms of discussing politics or disagreeing with a man, or confiding one's life history, not to sleep with a man too soon, and not to call him that frequently.  Women are also not expected to pay for the dates, although it's considered polite and generous if women offer to pay for a taxi or a round of drinks by the second or third date.How does this advice differ from what mothers told their daughters 50 years ago?  Oh, okay -- it's permissible to sleep with a guy somewhere around the fifth date. DUH!!!The whole concept of being someone other than who you are in order to ""capture"" a man, who will invariably discover that you are another person three months later, is so revolting. Now, I'm not prone to sleeping with a total stranger, using a steady stream of expletives with someone that I don't know, or telling a brand new person that there is mental illness in my family.  However, I need to be myself!  I don't want to catch or capture anything, especially a person.  I like to envision men just the way I view females -- I don't want to ""get"" one.  I want to find and be with a guy who likes me for myself.However, the very worst part of this book is that I suspect that most of what they said is true!@!  That's what makes it depressing.  Earlier this month, I read He's Just Not That Into You.  I was prepared to hate that book BUT I loved it!  Liz and Greg were so funny that it helped to cushion the hard truths.  They were also more homey or earthy -- I'm not sure what it was but I found it easier to relate to them than to these three guys, possibly because Liz and Greg did not repeatedly remind me of their professional status.Having said that, Liz and Greg made wild generalizations, which Rich, Chris and Brad did not make.  The latter acknowledged all kinds of different reasons why a man may not contact a woman after their first date or meeting, why he may bail at some point in the relationship or fail to commit.  To Liz and Greg, there was only one explanation -- he just wasn't into you.  Like Liz and Greg, these three guys truly cared about helping women to find the right mate.  Their heart is in the right place.After reading these two books, I've decided not to read any more self-help books about the sexes!  Ideally, I would like to be myself and to treat the men in my life exactly the same way that I treat the women.  But realistically, I realize that by doing so I may alienate some good guys.  It's a hard judgment call to make.  I don't understand why men can accept the fact that women sit on the Supreme Court, operate in hospitals, and fly airplanes but those same competent and ambitious gals are not supposed to ask a man out on a date!  Sad commentary.Sigrid Mac"

Overall, the book is OK, so I recommend it if the topic appeals to you.There are many interesting items brought up in the book - like how much our emotional well being depends on our ability to smell and how smell and taste are related. However, the book's organization left something to be desired, and it was a bit tentative on conclusions in spots.There is another book on smell that I liked better - the Emperor of Scent.

This demure British governess falls for his charms and allows him to expose her to the world of sensual pleasure. Hm. Interesting you may think, but even these scenes devoted to indulging the senses had me yawning and stretching. They sounded like well practiced lines an actor quotes with no feeling or passion.

She is in love with him but heard some vague rumours that men from his world have several wives which is not something she can live with. Being highly intelligent, she does not ask for clarifications but runs away to England where nothing and noone of consequence awaits her.  But it is better than a fate worse than death!Khair Bey is so obsessed that he stages an abduction by pirates, an auction where the heroine is up on offer to the highest bidder and what not.  After such costly and time consuming contrivances to have her where he wants, he allows her to reside with the women of his family, none of whom are wives by the way, and no sex until and if she decides.

And this woman was so pathetically dense I wanted to slap her. Once the heroine finds out the truth of her predicament she runs away to England yet again only to realize in the midst of her humdrum life that she truly wants to be with Khair Bey.

It's a wonderfully entertaining read. He talks about all the problems he had in his life early on, from his time in the minors, to the boredom in the bullpen (although his story about getting women in the stands to flash them is awesome) to his battles with team management, and lots on the Yankees.

doc08086,book,valid,"I say it's one of my favorites, but that's not the glowing praise it seems to be. Of the six book series there were only 3 that I liked, and tolerated pretty well. The three are: _This Duchess of Mine_ (the first EJ book I've ever read), _Duchess by Night_, and _A Duke of Her Own_. More than anything with this book, I was hungry for more of Villiers to be perfectly honest. I read this series completely out of order, _This Duchess of Mine_ was the first I read, and then I read _When the Duke Returns_ (which wasn't so bad, but not great) and then the third was _A Duke of Her Own_. I am reading the rest of the series mostly for the back story of Villiers, though the other characters were interesting in their own way (but not all of them- some fell flat). Here in _Duchess by Night_ however I did find myself entertained and enjoyed this book quite a bit. I cannot even remember if this is the book where the Lady Rawlings has a bit of a story or not...(maybe that story was part of the Duchess Quartet, I just remember skipping over that part to get to the main character's stories along w/Villiers). This is one of those problems that I do notice and find *slightly* annoying w/EJ's books. I cannot place certain characters properly in their own books, because there are just too many characters spread out to the point of total confusion and sometimes- frustration!I did like the story here w/Harriet pretending to be a man, and her forgiveness of Villiers, etc. The one character I honestly could have done w/out is the child of Lord Strange. It was a bit of an empty character to me. Sometimes it seemed that the child was just an excuse to throw the two main characters together for anything interesting other than attraction.I did love the story, but wish there was more depth."
doc01948,book,valid,"Jason Henderson evidently has a love affair going on with Dracula and Frankenstein, two of the most wellknown horror mythos in literature and the history of horror.  In the past, he wrote a comic series with a modern-day Van Helsing fighting against the lord of Vampires, Dracula.  The series was called Sword of Dracula.Now he's penning a new Alex Van Helsing series for young readers, and it starts off with a bang in Vampire Rising.  Admittedly, the Van Helsing name is what initially drew me in.  When you think of vampire hunters, Van Helsing has gotta be near the top.  Of course, the younger generation is going to think of Buffy first.But they're also going to think of Alex Rider, the 14 year old 007 created by Anthony Horrowitz that has revitalized the spy genre for young readers.  Rider and Van Helsing both have techware that would make any red-blooded young male sit up and take notes.Interestingly enough, Henderson not only ties the vampire legend to Dracula, but also to Frankenstein, and he's set the series near Lake Geneva, where Mary Shelley first wrote the famous short story that would later become a book that will live on in the annals of horror - oh yeah, literature too.The literary history captivated me.  The story of that weekend where Mary Shelley (then 18 years old), Lord Byron, John Polidori, and Percy Shelley has been mined by several writers, but this is a new twist.  The two literary histories, vampirism and Frankenstein, are inextricably bound in this book, and it looks like that's going to be a staple of the series.Young male readers are going to be entranced by the cornucopia of action Henderson throws into the story.  The opening chapter has Alex Van Helsing (15 and in boarding school) facing a vampire in the forest at night.  It's his first time.  He doesn't believe in such things and believes that his last name is just bad luck.From there, Henderson introduces his readers to what is going to be the staple of Alex's posse:  Mr. Sangster, the teacher who's really an anti-vampire superspy with some hidden abilities, Minhi, the girl with martial arts skills and who is a Brainiac, and two guy friends cut directly from the nerd herd.They're up against a vampire called Icemaker (almost a James Bond villain name, right?) who's trying to raise an old lover from the dead.  Of course, if he does that, it will probably doom the world.I like the cast of characters in this book, and yes, Sangster does remind me of a certain librarian from the Buffyverse, only tonied up a little more.  Minhi looked like she was ready to come on and stand out, but she got lost in the shuffle of the action even with some of the chapters dedicated directly to her.  There just hasn't been much in the way of character development, or really what's at stake so far.  However, the book reads really fast and I'm confident school librarians should put this one on their shelves because male readers will love the gimmickry, the references to pop culture, the action sequences that are movie-ready, and the one-liners.Hopefully there'll be more meat to dig into once Alex's parents figure out what he's been up to and have to deal with him knowing they've been keeping him in the dark."

doc06309,book,valid,"Oh, Tim Powers. No other author could write so convincingly of fishy ghosts in the Thames, zombie kids and ethereal vampires stalking the Pre-Raphaelites.For that is exactly what happens in ""Hide Me Among The Graves,"" a distant sequel to Powers' classic ""The Stress of Her Regard."" This is a horror novel for people with a love of art and philosophy, entwined with grey mist, childhood nightmares and countless quotes of classic poetry -- as well as beloved poets and writers for both villains and heroes.The Rossetti family has been haunted by the vampiric presence of their uncle, John Polidori, for countless years. But in 1862, Gabriel and his sister Christina begin to suspect that Gabriel's drug-addled wife Lizzie is being preyed on by not only Polidori, but another vampire. Meanwhile, John Crawford is contacted by an ex-prostitute named Adeleide McKee, with whom he once had a brief affair -- and, she now reveals, a daughter named Johanna.So now McKee, Crawford and the Rossettis must join forces to save the souls of their loved ones -- to save Johanna from Polidori's clutches, and Lizzie from being enslaved as another vampire. When Lizzie dies unexpectedly, they have an opportunity to shatter Polidori's power.Fast forward seven years. Both Gabriel and Crawford are shocked when their lost loved ones turn up in their homes -- one living, and one undead. Polidori's power has been shattered, but he's determined to regain it by using Christina's blood. Now the odd bunch must reunite before Polidori and his ancient queen use Johanna for their own ends, which could literally tear Britain apart.""Hide Me Among the Graves"" is a vampire novel for people who are literate, intelligent and intrigued by the arts (unlike books like ""Twilight""). The book not only has famed poets and artists peppering its pages, but you can feel Powers' love for classic art and poetry seeping through the pages. It doesn't hurt that Powers writes like a poet, with lushly atmospheric prose that clings to you like gossamer-soft spiderwebs.It's also scary. Really scary. Only a thin grey veil separates the humdrum world of London from the river of fishlike ghosts (""their arms waving like a moonlit kelp forest on the sea floor""), zombie fetii and ghostly vampires, and the people who see beyond that veil are changed forever. And his vampires are truly scary -- they can possess corpses, and they're violently jealous of the people they have claimed.Powers also excels at taking real-life figures -- Swinbourne, Trelawny, the Rossettis -- and turning them into rich, well-rounded characters. Christina is a particularly compelling character: a devoutly religious woman who is constantly tempted by the dark side (specifically, her attraction to Polidori. Vampire incest?). Gabriel is also fascinating, as an artist tormented by his love for his self-destructing, delusional wife.And the supporting characters -- the cold-as-ice Trelawny, the strong-willed ex-hooker Adelaide, and the fragile Crawford -- are just as well-rounded, fictional or non-fictional. It's a testament to Powers' skills that he can so easily interweave fact and fiction, giving supernatural explanations for real-life events like Siddal's death or Christina's rejection of her suitors.""Hide Me Among The Graves"" is a must-read for the literate vampire fan -- it's beautifully written, richly-characterized... and scary enough to keep you up at night."

I loved the book so much,  read the afterword... which caused me to actually read Shakespeare without being resentful of some twit of an English teacher requiring it. I found I loved Shakespeare today, as much as I loathed him when I was 17. Christopher Moore loves good literature and we're all gleefully taken in by him, learning to love it, too. That glimpse of what a treasure good writing really is, adds even greater value to this work. I bought the Kindle version of this, but am ordering a &#34; real&#34; hard copy.

doc07582,book,valid,"Susan Cooper is best known for her epic ""Dark is Rising Sequence,"" with all its Celtic legends and sense of mystery. But she tries a different tack in ""Seaward,"" an atmospheric little story that is just a little darker, more complex, and full of symbols and hints.West's mother was killed by some armed thugs, just as he escaped through a door into a strange land. Cally watched her parents waste away with a strange illness, before slipping through a mirror to the same land. When she encounters West, he's trying to escape from the ruthless, cold-hearted Lady Taranis.A kindly stranger named Lugan seems to be their best hope for escaping Taranis. As the two travellers cross the world that is an echo of our own, they encounter strange creatures such as the selkies, a talking insect that guides them over a desert, creatures made of stone, and the haunting specters of their own pasts and destinies...""Seaward"" seems like a pretty simple story at first -- two kids travelling across a bleak land. But in that simple storyline Cooper tackles questions about death and life, about grief, loss, love, about good and evil and how sometimes you can't easily classify anyone.Probably the biggest stumbling block in ""Seaward"" is the slightly dreamy tone of it all. Unlike Cooper's other books, there is no grounded ""homey"" base -- it's all like a legend right from the beginning. As a result, it takes awhile for the story to really get going, and there are long stretches where the characters are just walking.Though the setting is another world, it has hints of Celtic myth. The mysterious Lugan and Taranis aren't fully identifiable until the ending, but they seem like characters out of a legend. And mythic creatures like selkies are linked to the characters, by virtue of the thickened skin on Cally's hands.Cally and West are very richly drawn, confused and saddled with grief over their parents. It makes it all the more poignant as West overcomes his guilt, and Cally is tempted to find a new family. The only problem is that their romantic feelings seem to come out of left field.After the mass appeal of the ""Dark is Rising"" books, Susan Cooper tackles a more oblique, fantastical approach in ""Seaward."" Deceptively simple, and richly evocative."
doc05382,book,train,"First and foremost, I enjoyed reading this book -- I enjoyed learning about collecting baseball cards and also enjoyed learning about how some people doctor the cards. However, there were many times when I was reading the book that it wasn't clear to me who got the card in question from whom: the names of the real-life characters were just tossed around without really establishing in the reader's mind who they were. That came later, but should have come earlier to avoid confusion. And, I wasn't satisfied with the seeming lack of investigation about the origins of the card. I liked this book, and I think most readers will, but I often found myself wishing the authors had investigated more and written better."
doc00883,book,valid,"I attended the protest of the School of the Americas at Fort Benning this past November.  It was a moving experience, and many times Oscar Romero's name was mentioned.  During one gathering, it was announced that some Colombian trade unionists had been murdered by the paramilitaries.  The scale of the US-backed violence in Latin America is astonishing; but the struggle against it is inspiring.Romero would be thrilled to see how Latin American immigrants to the US have been making history with massive rallies to recognize their rights as children of God.  In the memory of Romero, and to honor the Latin Americans who are teaching US citizens about democracy and faith, I'd like to share this passage from ""The Violence of Love"":""With Christ, God has injected himself into history.  With the birth of Christ, God's reign is now inaugurated in human time.On this night (December 25, 1977), as every year for twenty centuries, we recall that God's reign is now in this world and that Christ has inaugurated the fullness of time.  His birth attests that God is now marching with us in history, that we do not go alone.Humans long for peace, for justice, for a reign of divine law, for something holy, for what is far from earth's reality.  We can have such a hope, not because we ourselves are able to construct the realm of happiness that God's holy words proclaim, but because the builder of a reign of justice, of love, and of peace is already in the midst of us."""

Laine comes from Greenwich, old money and a family name to live up to.

I think that was one of the big turning points in the novel, when Laine sees Nikki as more than her annoying roommate, but a girl who might not last the year at Wellington.At times, I wasn't too fond of Nikki.

doc06321,book,train,"Before reading this book, I couldn't help but wonder what a daughter who seemingly had devoted her entire life to embarrassing, humiliating, and politically opposing her father could possibly have to say about him as he entered the twilight of his life.  Now, after reading the book, I'm still somewhat at a loss.  The sentiments expressed are endearing, but the story line seems too slick, too polished, and perhaps a little too contrived to be easily believable.  Is it really possible that the author could ignore her father's guidance and fret about such things as death all through her lifetime and then in the sunset of his life take solace in his thoughts and the examples he had set for her when she was but a child?  I can't help but wonder.Her introduction of political bias toward the end of the book also disappointed me.  It seemed unnecessary; but it was also somewhat telling.  By doing so, Patti made it clear that she never did, and at the time the book was written still didn't, understand her father, conservatism in general, or her father's conservative ideals.  This was evident when she expressed surprise that her father could possibly believe that ""God doesn't make distinctions on the basis of skin color"" and went on to say that after hearing him say this she suggested to her brother that her father had spoken to the wrong convention.  Ronald Reagan must surely have been one of the last people on earth who would believe otherwise; and either convention would certainly have cheered such a pronouncement -- albeit for different reasons.  How could she not know that?In any event, and regardless of her motives, I'm glad Patti Davis wrote this book.  Hopefully, it helped set Reagan's mind at ease; and although it doesn't contain much new information about him, that which is included is quite revealing of his true nature and beliefs.  So, despite its diminutive size and any questions concerning the author's objectives, it still makes a contribution to the Reagan legacy.  As a minimum, it dispels the liberal myth that Ronald Reagan was not a spiritually motivated and deeply religious man.  Hence, whether or not you question the author's motives, as I did, it is still worth reading."
doc01529,book,valid,This book is very infomative on the needs and subtle differences you need to be aware of when dealing with spirited children. It mostly focuses on the child and how to adapt to make situations easier. I believe it is important to use positive lables but this alone will not change entrenched automatic behavior. With our spirited child setting clear liimits and enabling him to adapt and grow was what made the biggest difference. It was hard work but our child is now much happier and confident as a result. A good book on disciplin and limit setting is needed as a companion to the spirited child. I highly recomend reading &quot;Ain't Misbehavin&quot; and then read &quot;The Manipulative Child&quot;. These books show where the parent needs to make changes and how the child must learn to adapt. Walkin on egg shells and allowing the child to operte in his/her &quot;preferred style&quot; can escalate and reinforce unwanted behaviors. I read &quot;Raising your spirited child&quot; after we had corrected our childs behavior and found it useful and helpful but not a solution on its own.

doc01136,book,train,"I saved this (possibly final) Edith Layton book for a special occasion. I think having the whole house down with the flu a few days before the holidays counts, so I read it in one sitting this evening. I found it a wonderful example of what made Edith Layton one of the best writers Romance has to offer. If I were to sum up what makes a Layton novel a Layton I'd say a beautiful use of language, an eye to the details of the times, a quirk of convention, and strong characterizations. In a Layton novel it's not the big moments or the sweeping discovery of a multinational plot that advance the book along, it's the quiet and real discoveries of a life. It's Pippa looking down at her grandmother's head and realizing her halo of curls is a teased disguise for the cruel advances of age.I'll agree that Maxwell isn't the dominant force in this book. This is a heroine driven novel, the focus is on Pippa. Pippa may be romance novel beautiful, but she's not romance novel arrogant. She's a woman like many others, trying to find her way through a recent betrayal and a new attraction. She's rejected openly by more than one man, in more than one way, but gets out of bed the next morning the same as any of us have to do. Pippa has to care for an aging relative and accept the loss of her extended childhood. This is Pippa's book, and she's a wonderful character to spend some time with. The gift of an Edith Layton novel is that the eccentric grandmother isn't a point for farce (even when she's entertaining). Pippa's concern for her grandmother's potential mental state is the reader's concern. You care just as much for her well being as you do for Pippa and Maxwell.In Edith Layton's best work, her characters make difficult and realistic choice while operating under the obligations of their times. Families fall apart or reunite. Lovers are fated or doomed. Every one of her characters could strike up a conversation with you in the grocery line, operating under modern convention, and have the same core story to tell. Her books are about relatable human concerns. To Love A Wicked Lord touches on her finest moments without quite reaching all of them, but when you're aiming that high close is more than enough."

doc01369,book,valid,"This is yet another great travel narrative from an excellent writer, and, once again, Eric is accompanied by the indomitable (even by India and its casual and common berr-berri) Wanda, his wife and fellow adventurer. It turned out to be a very slow journey indeed, fraught with those difficulties that only India can create - but that just gives us, the readers, even more details, stories and evocative descriptions to enjoy - in fact you can find yourself wishing it slower. The idea was considered easy and enjoyable by the then Prime Minister, Gandhi - who armed Eric with a letter of commendation that did not much help - as it was the Ganges itself, that was the problem, a river without much water for the first 100 miles. They ran aground 63 times in the first six days and, frustrated, turned to train to bullock cart, bus, hiking, portage and back to boat again.Eric's `motive' for returning yet again to India is his simple like for the country and its people from his time as a ""very junior"" officer in the British Army - he never was an elite, plundering member of the Raj. One lyrical chapter covers their visit to Eric's old Army Post, now an Indian Army centre with the original mess hung with the records of two Sepoy who won the VC (Victoria Cross for Extreme Bravery) and a letter, rightly framed and accorded a honored placing, from another who, despite being a Prisoner of War in Germany writes back to his Battalion and requests that seven Rupees a month be stopped from his accumulating pay and donated to the International Red Cross.Far from reflecting condescending attitudes or trashing the endlessly varied and fantastic cults of Indian religions and their sometimes bizarre rituals, Eric finds time to see, hear, record, and appreciate it all, and finds everything fascinating. Thankfully, when he does start to get a little too detailed about these extraordinary Kings that are a mile high and fight battles lasting a thousand years, we can rely on Wanda to add some pithy comment.Rather than reflecting the perhaps expected 1980 Euro-Christian viewpoint, Eric contrasts one modern Indian mall, with its up-market restaurants, US Baptists Church and vendors of Christmas Cards and Scotch with the narrow lanes of the old `native city' where ""here the atmosphere was friendly and there was an air of excitement and animation lacking in the European part"".How this talented pair of travelers manage to counter the frustrations and infuriations of India that I experienced I can only wonder at, admire and applaud and I look forward to reading more accounts of their ever-readable journeys together."

doc01006,book,valid,"Unfortunately this is a book which does a fine historian no credit.  It is poorly written with many infelicitous lines but it has some value.  Liberals and conservatives will both hate its nuanced appreciation of Reagan, a man of limited understanding but some firm beliefs which turned sometimes in a dangerous direction and finally in a beneficent one.The book recalls for many of us, both those who voted for Reagan and those appalled by his election, why he won two national races for the presidency:  it was a reaction to the disintegration of the old Democratic Party caused by Vietnam and the destruction of the Solid Democratic South by the black uprising some call the Civil Rights movement.  The fear of the black underclass motivated many to trust the rightwing Republicans for the first time and this fear continues today with the appearance of Obama as a possible president.  McCain may win for the same reasons as Reagan. Obama benefitted from the Civil Rights Movement as did his wife but most blacks are no better off than before the end of segregation.  Indeed many were better off on the Southern plantations.Wilentz is a liberal Democrat but he has a good sense of where Reagan properly responded to what Americans really wanted and needed.  His analysis is fair and balanced, certainly more so than Fox News' contributions.  Wilentz has a good handle on the reasons why Bush 43 is a disaster, the worst president since James Buchanan and perhaps even worse than Buchanan.  His sympathy for Bill Clinton does not conceal the real weaknesses and deficiencies of Clinton, both personal and political.But in the last analysis this book has been gotten up for the 2008 election and it will not stand as any kind of permanent resource in our political history.  Wilentz has missed the boat here, I fear."

doc00591,book,valid,"This was one of those times where I was looking for something else and I happened to run across The Joshua Stone on the shelf. It was a random encounter, and a lucky one at that.The premise intrigued me when I noticed the mention of West Virginia. I once lived there and my wife&#8217;s side of the family is from the center of the state. Then, it being a thriller, I immediately conjured up images of Mothman, which I&#8217;ll admit is a stereotype. I HAVE read other thrillers involving West Virginia that had nothing to do with said creature.The only thing that gave me pause were the bible implications and the question and answer session at the back of the book. I got burned by another story a few years ago with that format that turned out to be, instead of a thriller, thinly disguised religious dogma wrapped around a thriller. However, after leafing through the questions and then the body of the novel, I felt more at ease. I also learned it was in third-person and found no sneaky first-person passages which are a huge turnoff for me, as well as no present-tense, which makes it unreadable. With those things out of the way, I took a chance on the unknown author.It was well worth it. I found the story engaging and well written. The plot involves time dilation and a chase to find the mysterious Joshua stones, which are the key to a process that causes this effect. I liked the hero and his reluctant partner and the mystery surrounding the characters they&#8217;re chasing. I also liked the way the story ended.The writing was tight and the chapters and scenes mostly short and to the point. There was a little bit of head-hopping which jarred me here and there, but otherwise, the writing was solid third-person. Though the author used plenty of bible references as source material, they weren&#8217;t preachy which I was thankful for. The editing was also excellent.The story was a nice surprise and I now want to look for other books by this author. Highly recommended."

I've always done pretty good on the first eight rules, but No. 9 is the reason that I've spent most of my career working for myself. That way I can't fight with the boss, or if I do, I can win because I'm the boss as well as the employee.Rule 16, Read Books, is one with which I completely agree. The best business leaders in the world write books on their lives, philosophies, even business rules. I find that I can't read one of these books without picking up an idea or two that makes the small price of the book.As stated in the title, this book is a little set of 56 rules for a successful business career. Each rule is only two to four pages long. It won't take long to read, but you'll pick up an idea or two"
doc03984,book,train,"I've read all of Marcus Borg's books and have recently read &quot;The Heart of Christianity&quot;. From a conservative evangelical background, I have always strugged with his approach, yet I keep coming back for more. He has helped me grow in my faith, and be open to see things from other angles. Despite his orthodox/unorthodox theology, there is a spirituality in this book, that cuts to my heart. He is all about actually experienceing Christianity in this life, and I find his writing to have a spiritual quality that, for some reason, comes home to me. I may not ever agree with all he writes, but he lifts the faith beyond the factual to the experiential and to its root. I heartily recommend this book to everyone wishing to grow and struggle in faith."
doc01170,book,train,"I enjoyed the book because it was different than the usual ""sex first romance later and marriage last of all"" storyline.  The book starts out on the couple's wedding night so that much is a given.  But they married for practical reasons, not love.  The book is about falling in love (and a little spy business).It's interesting that one critical review disliked Lucy and another disliked Simon.  Neither one of them was perfect -- they both made mistakes.  Simon left with no explanation and conducted an apparent affair right in front of Lucy.  Lucy was more angry that Simon didn't tell her he was a spy than when she thought he was having an affair.  I could understand both positions and really enjoyed the process of Simon and Lucy finding love in their marriage.  I hope Ms. Mullins continues with Foxworth and Gin's story and another spy adventure in which Lucy and Gin can work with Simon and Fox."
doc08301,book,valid,"Recommended to me: ""SO much love for this series! The first book is great, but nowhere near as good as the rest. This series pretty much defines political intrigue with all the schemes and secrets, riddles and mysteries. The author does a fantastic job playing with different narrative styles and the characters are wonderful. Recommended because you like Shadow and Bone, Grave Mercy, and Graceling.""Recommended for: fans of Kristin Cashore; Robin LaFevers; Rachel Hartman; the Lumatere Chronicles; the Fire and Thorns trilogy; fantasy that straddles the literary-commercial line; and books that focus on characters and feature political intrigue; and for YA (fantasy) writers.The Thief | The Queen of Attolia | The King of Attolia | A Conspiracy of KingsSpoiler-free review/declaration:You may recall that I was not the hugest fan of The Thief. I thought that it was a solid read and that it was clear that Megan Whalen Turner had huge potential even if the first book lacked that special spark which would make me love it... and yet I am so glad that I didn't give up after that book. Everything gets better; it's so very clear how much MWT improved from that novel and that that novel was setting up the rest of the series. And now, because I love the series so much, a part of me is now wondering whether I was too harsh in my judgment of The Thief.So why should you read this series?This series does one of my favorite things: it folds back in on itself. It's not just that the characters continue to grow and our understanding of the world increases but also that there are references to character histories and events introduced in the previous novels across the entire series. They make for rich insight and wonderful humor for readers who continue with the books. Right now the only series I can think of which also does this really well is Harry Potter.It has wonderful dry humor that feels authentic. One thing that I've noticed about YA is the abundance of one liner humor. While I enjoy a great deal of it, sometimes I think that it's not appropriate for the series in question, or it seems that the author has thought of the jokes and then given them to the character (rather than the other way around, which is what it should be). This series has humor founded in our understanding of the characters - this is the kind of humor you get when you know the author has a complete understanding of the characters she's created. This is the kind of humor that's not going to feel dated in time because it's established within the text.You know how I'd said that I liked reading about the Victorian era because something about that setting gave female characters a chance to show their fire? This isn't the Victorian era, but the female characters are no doubt fighting sexism and coming out strong, fierce, and formidable. This is a mostly male-centered world, and yet the two queens are (except for Gen) the stand-out characters who make their country strong. They have completely different ruling styles and different cultures for their countries, but they each are characterized well, willing to make the hard choices and do whatever they can for their people. I also love the twists on Greek mythology that Turner added to round out their characters and bring a wry note of humor which connects back to her themes.I don't think I've ever been as entranced by a main character as I am by Gen. He's not a Gary Stu; he's quite flawed - condescending towards those he perceives are fools, whiny, lying, cocky, brazen. Somehow, however, over the series, along with all the other characters, you come to love Gen's ridiculous lies and his flaws and wait to see how he'll turn you on your feet with his resourcefulness, determination, loyalty, and cleverness. For all those who loved that Rae Carson showed how smart Elisa is, you'll certainly love how MWT shows how clever Gen is. Gen has a lot of depth and complexity that gets explored across the series. He's one of the most well-drawn, fascinating protagonists who I've read about, and probably the only protagonist in YA who I'd follow through to other series (as in, it wouldn't matter if everything else didn't work because he does).There are complex and satisfying romances that are free of angst. Or at least of the typical variety. They're very subtle in how they form, but you can tell how well suited each person is for the other. There is little emphasis on what the other person looks like and more on who they are and how the two people match in temperament and attitude. I'm the kind of person who wants her romantic scenes. Never did I think that I'd like a series that has so much of its subtle emotional shifts off screen, but this - this is going down in my favorites. You know it's the mark of a great writer if she makes you believe in the romances despite all the obstacles, and believe me they are significant.These are as close to unpredictable plots as you can get. This is mastery of unreliable narration and narrative misdirection combined across the series. You know all along that these characters are hiding something and that you're not getting the full picture - it's all a part of the politics, the situation, the characters and what they choose to admit to themselves. The key is in trying to understand what details have been left out from the limited third person perspective, or focus on what details the first person perspective is not mentioning. Even then you think you know everything until you realize that it's also a fantasy world, and no matter how much you're learning, there's always something new Turner will include to surprise you.There are very few novels that can handle shifts in narration as well as these do. Don't you feel frustrated sometimes when a novel is shifting between first and third perspective? Alternating chapters of each or just alternating first person, etc.? These novels are among the first that I've read that handle PoV shifts so well that I'm convinced there's no other way the books could have been written. The shifts in perspective are not only there to enhance the plot but also to enhance character and character growth and to further the symbolism within the series. Don't believe me? Read The Book Smuggler review of this series. Ana explains this better than I have.As a writer, this series is invaluable to understanding more about the craft. I'm not the only one who thinks so - author Elizabeth Fama wrote a post about that as well. Every detail, every word in this series counts. Her writing style is similar to Kristin Cashore's with its textured feel, but I might go so far as to say Turner has layered in more emotion and complexity to each interaction - and not just for the main characters but in the dialogue between lesser characters as well. I am probably going to buy paperback copies soon so that I can look at the text more closely.Quick impressions of each book: The Thief: fun filler to introduce us to the awesome showstealer of the series, Gen. The Queen of Attolia: has the most political intrigue of the series and features the most subtle romance I've ever read. The King of Attolia: amps up what was already established in The Thief but in a more political setting. A Conspiracy of Kings: probably the most typical of the books in terms of YA character arcs but with a harsher, more fulfilling/overarching and political feel.Three things of note: I really wished that they'd given us a map. If you're going to have books about political scheming and sneaking around the castle, it'd be much easier to follow if we too were allowed to follow along. I'm not a visual reader and though the details were there, I still had a hard time trying to align every thing in my head. It's a shame because MWT's writing style feels very similar to Cashore's and Kristin Cashore's novels all have maps. Another thing to note is that this series is one that straddles the line between literary and commercial, so if you're not a fan of books that focus less on drama/angst, villain/hero showdowns, or full-blown action scenes, I'd advise you to check out an excerpt first. I'm also not sure that I would give these to teens unless they were accustomed to reading a lot. Because it's so complex and a lot of it is in the subtle details or implications, I don't know whether they'd enjoy this as much; I don't know that I, as a teen, would have understood the subtext.Right now, if you asked me to choose one YA book to claim as my own -- as if I had written it -- I would probably choose The King of Attolia. There are a lot of other contenders, but I don't think that I've ever read another YA novel with this level of character and plot complexity and layered writing. (Obviously Harry Potter has a lot, a lot of complexity, but I'm not going to even pretend I could ever write something like that. Not that I could write something like this anyway, but you know what I mean.). As much as I love pretty turns of phrases and writing that sets atmosphere and mood, I would sacrifice that for the absolute mastery of character building in these novels. I am really surprised that these novels didn't win more awards.Please give this series a chance. As you may have noticed, books two through four have gone onto my books that define me as a reader list. If you've read The Thief and not been completely impressed, please continue onto The Queen of Attolia and see whether you like it more. I am still struck dumb by how much I love this series, so I don't have a blurb summary in mind for here, but if you are a fan of Kristin Cashore, Robin LaFevers, Rachel Hartman, the Lumatere Chronicles, the Fire and Thorns trilogy, fantasy that straddles the literary-commercial line, and books that focus on characters and feature political intrigue, or are a YA (fantasy) writer, this series is for you. Also for fans of The False Prince.For more reviews:The Book Smugglers on the series - also spoiler freeThe Thief - critical reviews the author has quotedThe Queen of Attolia - sameThe King of Attolia - sameA Conspiracy of Kings - sameSince it's been published for a while, you can probably find a bunch of reviews just by going to the individual Goodreads pages.

He can vary his technique from intimate to grand scale and can interchange voices so you're never sure whether he is writing autobiography or pure fiction.  In ANGEL ON THE ROOF he gives us stories that span a long period of his output and while each of the stories stands on its own (at times even in a short 5 or 6 pages)there is enough linkage  or afterthoughts that somehow tie this collection together. Yes, the stories are intensely interesting individually and do continue to show Banks' feelings about the alienation and abuse of parent-child relationships, and people in general,  and yes they can be read individually as a bedside book for finding somnolence.  But to stop reading these collected stories as a book would rob the reader of the tangents that make for enhancing the experince as a novel. For sheer clarity of line, pungent descriptions of the quality of air/space/cold/skies etc  Banks is as good as contemporary writers get.  This is a richly rewarding book on so many levels that it clearly belongs in every library...with frequent easy access!"

Neither he nor his separated wife found solace in one another with Annabel tending to float in and out of his life.  Instead Doc lives for his work.Doc visits a domestic murder scene where apparently the common law wife, Native American Rosa Littlefoot, killed her abusive husband Lee Roy Pugh.  In spite of his full agenda, Doc takes their four month old child into his home.  Annabel makes one of her evanescent visits and claims she is capable of nurturing the infant, but Doc has doubts.  As he investigates the murder, Doc wonders if his girlfriend is right and that he should divorce his spouse so everyone can get on with their lives.A DREAM OF WOLVES is not your usual ME vs. monstrous odds that Vegas would take no book.  Instead this tale is more of a human drama centering on morality based on one's relative outlook on life.  Doc struggles with his future knowing that even in his late fifties, he can expect a life span of two to three decades more.  However, what makes Michael C. White's tale special is the secondary cast also examines their present lives in terms of their future.  Placing all that inside a mystery turns Mr. White's novel into a dream book for sub-genre fans that want realistic characters not superheroes.Harriet Klausner"

doc01585,book,train,"Reading others&#8217; journals, diaries, letters, is a kind of guilty pleasure, I suppose.  As an inveterate journal keeper, I compare myself, with strong judgment, to Oates&#8217; efforts.  At the same time, I find many similarities of thought and habit that make her book a nurturing read.  She describes better and in fine detail what we both experience in our amateur playing of the piano:  great delight!  She in Chopin, I in Bach.  And we share delight in reading fine fiction, in one case even for the same book:  Dickens&#8217; Our Mutual Friend.  We agree that being famous is a pain, although she has had to endure it and I have not.  I find her experience of working on her novels interesting, though I haven&#8217;t found myself drawn to read any of them yet.  (I do have her book, them, sitting on my &#8220;to read&#8221; shelf.)

This is a memoir in the truest sense of the world, a journey of one of the entertainment world's most original, engaging and talented members.  I have always been a fan of the professional Alan Cumming -- admiring of his chameleon-like adaptation to his roles, his ability to take on anything.  Usually with a twinkle in his eye, but with an aura of vulnerability that somehow makes it through that glint.  Who could portray MacBeth and then go right into the emcee of Cabaret with barely a moment's rest between.  Add to that the manipulative, complex and totally loyal character of Eli Gold.  So when did he have time during this past busy year to pen a memoir of such honesty, depth, and style?  Most think of him, so he describes himself, as an elf in a middle aged man's body.  This book is a revelation, not of inconsequential pap, but substance and what he holds in his deepest heart.  Thank you, Mr. Cumming."

From the moment the first chapter turns the clock back to the summer of 1956, I lived out the remainder of the story through Callie Ann's eyes. Marjorie Reynolds paints a clear and vivid picture of the little white house where Callie Ann lives, and the drive in across the grass that stays open all summer. As I absorbed chapter after chapter, all of my senses shifted into overdrive. It was easy to picture the brightly printed shirtwaister dresses that Callie Ann's mother wears, the hot gravel that lines the parking lot and the dreamy romantic entanglements that play themselves out on the big screen as well as below it. This book puts the reader in touch with the all of the wonderful elements of summer while focusing on the heartache of being twelve years old and not really knowing who to turn to when things get rough. I was even able to put faces on the characters, and would love to see this story made into a movie one day. A beautiful first novel!"

Kesey has said of Stone, ""a professional paranoid, someone who sees sinister forces behind every Oreo cookie.""Prime Green: Remembering the Sixties (P.S.)is a remembrance of his life and times from the late fifties through 1970-71. It is certainly a more sober (or grounded?) reflection of wild times in a wild decade. Although he clearly remembers those times fondly, Robert Stone is able to address how some things that were fun and seemed revelatory at the time may not hold up to scrutiny after forty more years on the planet. Stone explores where the promise of those times went wrong even if he's not always entirely sure of just how.While I admire Stone's fiction (maybe I'll start a reread project) more thanPrime Green: Remembering the Sixties (P.S.); this is a quick (give it a weekend) and enjoyable review of a critical and crazy decade from a now mature mind who lived it to the hilt."

Like 2008's Game Change, this book was written shortly after the 1960 election and includes extensive insights from embedded journalists. You step into the inner campaign sanctums of JFK and Nixon, journey with them around the country, watch the strategies unfold, hear the strain in their weary voices, and wait on tenterhooks for each electoral vote to come in.Also, White puts the election in its proper context. It wasn't just about JFK vs. Nixon. It was about the changing demographics of the country, the changing ways people voted and the reasons why. It was about a half dozen other viable candidates who have been largely forgotten by history - the liberal lion Hubert Humphrey, the professorial Stuart Symington, the perennial also-ran Adlai Stevenson, the hawk who bucked his own party Nelson Rockefeller. I was just as fascinated about their stories as the main two candidates, moreso, because they were fresh and unfamiliar."

However, once past the 90 or 100 page mark I found the book to be very satisfying and interesting. The main character is a drunk, and sometimes drunks are just so closed in on themselves that it can give the reader a sense of claustrophobia. I loved the Mexican setting the the 1930's and I think there could be some argument as to whether or not this book really takes place all in one day (with the liberal use of flashbacks) or whether it takes place over the course of two or three days. I read it twice, one in print and once on Audible.com and it is very hard to tell. It's one of those books that you either like or don't, and out of everyone in my book club I was the only one who read it twice, and pretty much the only one who read it once. A lot of people just gave up on it, but I liked it very much and I do recommend it to people who don't mind reading about alcoholics (and I know a lot of people have been brutalized by alcoholics and just don't want to read books like this... and to those of you I would say skip it) and if you can't stick with a book through the first 100 pages, then you are pretty much not going to like this book because the first 100 pages are brutal.I think Malcolm Lowry can write and I wold definitely pick up another of his books if he has them."

Unfortunately, his attempts go very awry and he makes an error on nearly everyone's birthdate/age in the story. The picture section is nice, but nearly all the dates are wrong, and the character's ages at different periods are very muddled, such as Sal Maranzano being born in 1868 (according to Davis), but being in his ""mid forties"" in 1931. There are many other such discrepancies but they are somewhat unimportant, the largest error being his reliance on other people's books for his storytelling. The book on Paul Castellano by the two special agents (which I have read three times) is not all that reliable, and several upper-echelon FBI employees have contradicted their bugging and surveillance techniques, instead saying that their story is bolony. Perhaps the biggest mistake was focusing on the media's darling, John Gotti, ... But, succumbing to popular demand, Davis focuses half if not most of the story on Gotti and his violent antics rather than telling the full story on the legendary Carlo Gambino or the aloof but erudite Paul Castellano. As a result, we get a rehash of aforamentioned events told from books such as Goombata (Volkman, 1990) and Gangbusters: How The FBI Broke The Mob.Perhaps the most interesting part of the book is the brief deviation from the Gambino story, where Davis meets Mr. Lucky Luciano, the original boss of bosses, in Naples, and has a kurt but direct exchange with him about the roots of organized crime in America. This is telling of Davis' skill has a intervewer, and it shows that he has seen the landscapes of Italy he so vividly described in the introduction.Still, after reading the 500-page tome, one has the feeling of having read an extremely long news article, rather than a fulfilling biography.6.5/10"

Not sure what that means but it sounds deep.After reading, and enjoying, &#34;The accounting&#34; by Lashner I looked up more books by the author and down-loaded this book to my kindle.  This is obviously one in a series featuring &#34;Victor Carl&#34; as the main character but i found it worked as a stand-alone book.Victor isn't your usual Grisham-type lawyer. He is more a red-polyester-tie-wearing, Columbo-esque, bumbling, gumshoe-wearing shady-PI type lawyer. I think that about covers it. On second thought maybe Dr. Bob was the main character.This is a book review, not a book report, so there is no need for me to give a synopsis of the story.

doc06603,book,train,"Lauren Oliver is one of my favorite YA authors. BEFORE I FALL is still one of my all time favorite books. When this, her new novel for adults, was offered for review, I was very excited.**REMINDER: this is a novel for adults. There are themes of alcohol abuse, sexuality, suicide, and violence.**ROOMS is a hard novel to review. It balances a family drama, where each person deals with their own secrets, along with a paranormal storyline. The Walker family's old house is haunted by two ghosts, who used to live there in different points in time. Both ghosts have their own stories interwoven with the goings on of the Walkers. So the narrative flits between several characters with each chapter. This may be confusing for some readers who want a traditional narrative. In fact, this book reads more like a collection of short stories.A debate subject among most reading crowds is the unlikable character. It seems that many readers have a penchant to want to like every character they read about. If they don't like them, they can't--and won't-- care about them. I don't mind an unlikable character, but I know there are some readers who will not like most of the characters in ROOMS. Like I said, everyone in the book has secrets, and these secrets make them do things which will not sit well with many people. Personally, I could only empathize with Trenton Walker, the troubled teenage son. He's not innocent of being &#34;unlikable,&#34; and he does some disturbing things, but he felt more fleshed out than the other characters.There's a lot of simile in the novel. Simile used every once in a while can make for some wonderful lines, but it was present in almost every third sentence. Most of it didn't feel natural. It took me about two and a half weeks to finish it because I had to take breaks from the writing style. But once all of the tiny story threads start to wrap together, I had to know how it ended.ROOMS may not be my new favorite Ms. Oliver novel, but it's a decent collection of vignettes involving a family and the ghosts who happen to be present in their strained lives. I would say, if you're curious about this book, to get it from your local library."
doc03996,book,train,"Meyers sandwiches the 114 sayings of Thomas (in English and Coptic), and his commentary on that text, between two essays: his introduction, and a dozen or so pages from the famous humanist, Harold Bloom.The middle sections may or may not be worth the price of the book.  (I haven't looked over the notes yet.)  I find Thomas a bit ""hammy,"" both in the sense that (having read a few Taoist and Buddhist works) Gnostic metaphysics strike me as pretentious, and in the sense that in their lack of historical or moral interest, they are ""un-kosher,"" don't sound like a Jewish prophet.  This doesn't sound like Jesus to me; it sounds like an Alexandrian philosopher.  But it's worth reading Thomas for his importance in modern Jesus debates.Surrounding the text one finds two slices of ""wonder bread"" of doubtful nutritional value.Meyer properly attempts to put Thomas in context, but offers some dubious arguments in the process.  He repeats the standard Jesus Seminar line that Q is very like Thomas.  The view that Thomas is an early text is often based on the assumption that both are ""sayings Gospels.""  (A rather oxymoronic concept.)  More importantly, as I show in Why the Jesus Seminar can't find Jesus, and Grandma Marshall Could, Q is radically different from Thomas.  First, even the Jesus Seminar version of Q contains some stories and miracles, which Thomas does not.  More fundamentally, while Q contains some of the most profound moral teaching in all literature, Thomas edits almost all of it out.  Q is 37-50% moral teaching; Thomas is about 2%, and even that can be pretty anemic.  (""Don't lie, and don't do the things you hate."") Odd that a ""sayings Gospel"" would edit out the Sermon on the Mount!  Even odder that Meyer does not notice!  Nor do other Jesus Seminar scholars, Elaine Pagels, or Harold Bloom.In fact, in my analysis of Thomas and the Gospels, I found that Thomas was less like the canonical Gospels than any other ancient writing I surveyed.  The convention of calling it a ""Gospel"" at all is, in my opinion, highly dubious.Meyer claims that the ""absence of allegorical interpretations"" in Thomas' version of the parable of the sower ""helps confirm that such elements were added later,"" and therefore Thomas contains material that predates the Gospels.  But scholars like Sanders and Jenkins have rebutted this argument.  John Meier, N. T. Wright, and Richard Hays also give reason to believe Thomas depends on the canonical Gospels.  Meyer is honest enough to admit that some scholars take this view.  The problem is (I argue) ""early Thomas"" scholars get the worst of the debate.  In fact, often they simply ignore opposing arguments.  (Pagels admitted to me she had not read Meier or Wright's views on Thomas.)While a good writer, Harold Bloom is in even further over his head.  He uncritically accepts the view that Thomas offers an ""earlier Jesus.""  Both Meyer and Bloom repeatedly cite Burton Mack, whose gifts, in my opinion, are more those of a myth-maker than a historian.  Bloom also glibly repeats Meyer's error about Thomas being similiar to ""Q.""Bloom expresses amazement that the Gospels contain only a few Aramaic sayings of Jesus: ""If you believed in the divinity of Jesus, would you not wish to have preserved the actual Aramaic sentences he uttered?""  The answer is, first of all, Jesus may have spoken mostly in Greek.  But also, Bloom seems to have a less sophisticated and more magical notion of language than the early Christians.  In the Christian Scriptures, Jesus is the ""Logos,"" the translation into humanity of the nature of God.  By speaking in different languages in Acts, the Holy Spirit in effect blessed all languages, and the act of translation.Bloom asks, ""Is it not an extraordinary scandal that all the crucial texts of Christianity are so suprisingly belated?""  He should know better.  The earliest extant Buddhist text is from 600 years after the Buddha.  The earliest account of the resurrection, by contrast, was written a mere 20 years after the fact, and the first extant text is a mere 90-100 years later.  Nor is 40 years (to Mark) so long; I could transcribe 1st hand accounts of the bombing of Nagasaki (where I once lived) tomorrow, from eyewitnesses, 61 years after the fact."

doc07455,book,train,"I've never seen Jorge Cruise speak, and have no desire to.  There is something about this guy that really irks me.  So, keep that in mind as you read my negative review, because I definitely could be unfairly biased.That said, Jorge Cruise calls the exercises he recommends ""Cruise Moves"".  Isn't that enough to turn one off? No longer are they ab crunches, for instance, or swiss ball balance moves, they are ""Cruise Moves"".  He now markets flax oil and it's ""Jorge Cruise's Flax oil"".The other criticism I have regarding this book is his recommended snacks.  Cruise has a diet plan in place that includes two snacks daily.  And, he makes no distinction in the quality of the snack as long as they are equal to approximately 100 calories each.  This means that, according to him, two oreos twice per day--every day--is just fine.  This might not interfere with weight loss, but these oreos or other foods like oreos are still devoid of any nutritional value and are still NOT good for you.  No matter what you want to believe, 200 calories per day made up of 1 tbsp of peanut butter and an apple, or a whole wheat English muffin with cinnamon are both better choices than oreos.  And, learning to choose what's better for your health in the long term--which includes learning to say ""no"" to oreos, is an important lesson to learn, I think.  Save those oreos for your cheat meal which you're allowed one time per week.He also recommends a tsp of oil with every meal.  Flax oil and other fats are very very good for you.  Although, I'm not sure it's really necessary if you are eating properly and your diet includes lots of fatty fish, like salmon, and some red meat or chicken and if you use olive oil to cook your foods in.  As healthy as certain fats are, they are still heavy in calories.  And, no matter what, we still have to burn more calories than we take in to lose weight.I'm optimistic that this diet will work, though.  He keeps calories to about 1425 per day for women, which is definitely reasonable for a moderately active woman.  And, the basic information is compatible with the current health information.  Eating every three hours is proven to keep your metabolism moving and to avoid going into starvation mode--which starts burning muscle for fuel-- a state we all wish to avoid.You might find Jorge Cruise is right for you.  The information in here isn't groundbreaking, although the media would seem to say otherwise.  Body for Life is still the best program, I think.  I also think The Thin Commandments Diet is good, as are The Abs Diet (watch portion sizes, though, if you're a woman--the Abs Diet is written for men first, although it's great for women.  Just decrease the portion size, remember) and-- only if you're truly really dedicated and fairly fit to begin with, The Ultimate New York Body Plan."

I bought the book for my husband (the one who instigated the divorce) to help him understand his own feelings of guilt, sorrow, and how to move on.

doc06061,book,valid,"Searing, potent and unflinching, Compromised is a uncharted look into life on the streets and what it means to be pushed aside by society. Torn between her love of her father and her anger at being betrayed by him, Maya finds herself thrust into a world unimaginable to anyone not in it. Though her life has been less than ideal, she would easily take the cons and quick escapes to an orphanage.Maya is a reverberating character, holding a powerful mix of courage and fear. Her character dynamic and progression is painfully realistic with her initial reactions to becoming a warden of the state to her decision to leave and try on her own. Holding a certain level of naivety, Maya's struggles are undeniably believable. Despite her anger at her father, she is unable to turn her back on him completely. Many of her reactions are wrenching to read but pull out the true nature of this story. With her penchant for science and a constant need to develop a hypothesis and procedure, Maya's character is pitched in a unique way. Though she has a large vocabulary, her school intelligence is not likely to cause a dissonance with readers.Sick of being passed around to foster families that don't care, Nicole goes with Maya. Their companionship is both endearing and entertaining, the two tied together by a tragic cause. With nicknames understood only in context, they forge a friendship seen by the reader before the girls recognize it. The softer sides of both shines through, lurking beneath the forced rough exterior they must have to survive not only in foster homes and orphanages but on the streets as well. With an affliction for mobsters, much akin to Maya's science obsession, Nicole's character is as strongly defined and developed as Maya's. Strengthening the overall effect more, the banter between these two provides relief from the overall dark air of the book.Further along their way, the two girls find a young boy also living on the streets. His character is as noteworthy, memorable and heartrending as Nicole and Maya, all three pulling the reader's compassion and emotions. With his own quirks and habits, Klon adds a strong dynamic to the girls, mixed further with his unique way of viewing things. He tugs Maya and Nicole between being motherly towards him and their own obligations to themselves. The battle between putting themselves first and helping the group comes up often, interspersed with their growing desperation to survive and the things they are willing to do to make it happen.In a society where people on the streets, young and old alike, are written off and ignored, Compromised will pitch a jarring look into the other side. How wrong is stealing, when a cheap bag of cough drops could mean the difference between a night of pain and some sort of relief? How hurt is the diner who's stuck with a bill for some pancakes and coffee when it means some homeless teens have food in their bellies for the day? These questions and more are thrust forward in Compromised, ensuring the reader will rethink their state of mind on many things that have become accepted as normal.With an unerringly strong voice and writing, Compromised pulls the reader in from the start and doesn't let them go even after the book has finished. A dark and depressing overall air mixed with innumerable twists, this is a gripping read unlike any other. The reader will constantly question the fate of all three kids, wondering if they will find a way to their goals or end up dying, frozen on the streets like many others. Death is lurking constantly around them, reminding them in countless ways. Intensely developed and defined characters, a guttural world created, and echoing writing, this terrifying look at events still taking place in our modern world is sure to pack a punch and remain with the reader."
doc03785,book,valid,"I read every additional note and reference looking for more. This is excellent. The idea of twelve kings fits nicely with the twelve tribes of israel. This is a realistic translation from a book claimed tohave been written by the Magi themselves. The star the Magi followed was actually an angel! I always wondered why the angel didn't also warn them not to visit the wicked king, but this book answered my question. It sounds like the group of 12 magi were apprehended as they were passing through Jerusalem to get to Bethlehem. The kings servants opened the scrolls and read aloud the prophesies written in their own storage places in Jerusalem. The king seemed amazed that the prophecies were coming to pass before his eyes. However, his lust for power seemed to overcome him after he realized he'd been tricked when the Magi didn't return. Makes one wonder if the Magi would have been killed if they had returned. The angel did warn them not to go back by the same route."
doc04897,book,valid,"I can kind of understand where, and why it was written the way it was. Though, I still don't know why, throughout the whole book, Ross didn't feel the need to use quotation marks whenever someone speaks. The heavy British slang was to give the characters more depth, the bouncing around, seemingly jumbled, way of moving from one point of the story to another, was to give the reader a glimpse into the often twisted mind of Sam Marsdyke. But just because I see reason behind it, doesn't mean I like it.All of this combined to make the book hard to read. The slang was the typical ""Oi"" instead of ""Hey"" to give everyone the British accent. But it didn't stop there... In British terminology what we Americans call a flashlight, they across the pond call a torch. The book was crammed full of these types of words. Case in point, before you even get five words into the book Sam calls people ""Daft sods"".Most of the terms you figure out right away based on their use, others you have to wait until they pop up later in the book, and are used in a way you can understand.And then Sam develops a language of his own, referring to Josephine's father as ""Chickenhead"", and some other people as ""tomatoes"". Sometimes you're left scratching your head.Sam's shift from one place to another is hard to follow at times, to the point where you don't know if he's dreaming it or not. At times it seems like there are hours between one point to another that are just lost. Just when you start to relax and find some fluidity, it changes gears and you're left to regather.Then there's pseudo conversations that Sam has in his head. Those are at least easy to spot when he has them with say, animals, the chickens and sheep. Not so easy when he has imaginary conversations with the towns folk.While it is clear during the course of the story that Sam is disturbed, I wouldn't exactly say he was malevolent. He kills a chicken for looking at him wrong?There are little instances like these all through, where you see just how twisted Sam thinks. Things that he finds funny are creepy. It goes a lot deeper than just being an anti-social cast out. I think Sam has more pointers leading to Psychopath than Sociopath. He doesn't seem to feel much remorse for anything, or see anything wrong with what he does.But I think upbringing does have a lot to do with his personality. At one point in the story you learn about a bucket in the backyard, where every summer if the cat or dog has babies and there is no need of them, or they are runts, they get drowned in this bucket. And it's Sam's job to hold the lid down until they die. It sounds like Sam's father is a cold individual, without many feelings himself.I really didn't like the way it ended, as it still left Sam as a threat to society.  Sam doesn't seem to have learned much about morals, or even accountability for his actions. I'm not entirely sure that at the end of it all, Sam even sees that he did anything wrong to Josephine.I'm glad I only paid $1 for it at my local bookstore.Overall I don't  recommend this book."

As things grow steadily more dangerous, can Leo come back and be there for Maddy in her time of greatest need?M.L. Malcolm has written a novel that will appeal to many readers.  It has romance, intrigue and suspense.  She artfully weaves real people, many in the early stages of the spy game, into the novel to lend it authenticity.

Gonzalez does a good job framing church movements in the context of general trends of thought and covers key secular thinkers and movements where appropriate.  He also does well covering the whole church and following the developments of the papacy, Catholic church, and Orthodox.  However, this leads to the treatment of eras in parallel accountings rather than a linear narrative which was confusing at times.  The pictures are fun, timeline could be more helpful in its presentation, and while I would have liked more maps, this text has the most helpful maps of those that I read on this era.  It is also not referenced but it does have extensive recommended readings.

Until recently he's never really questioned where he came from, but after a not-so-chance meeting with Merlin, he's curious.  The answers are not what he ever expected to find and actually, they're quite hard to really believe.  He's King Arthur? As he and his sister and knight, Kay, embark on a series of adventures to save the worlds, they'll have to face dragons, elves, witches, and any number of magical beings to free Merlin in hopes of saving the world.Artie and Kay were really fun characters to get to know.  I really liked that they had a great family dynamic with their father, Kynder, and with each other.  Their personalities were also quite complimentary--when Artie was nervous, Kay was strong and vice versa.  As Artie learned more about who he was and Excalibur showed him new things, he came into his own (whereas at the beginning, Kay was clearly the dominant one).Overall, I felt like this was a good fantasy adventure for young readers, probably between ages 9-10.  While I personally didn't enjoy it as much as I have enjoyed some other MG fantasy novels, I felt like it had good pacing and a fun, adventurous storyline that will offer young fantasy readers something to enjoy. Slightly older MG readers may find that the dialogue and storyline is a tad simplistic and the non-ending is a bit unsatisfying.  I walked away feeling like the cliffhanger ending was unnecessary and they never resolved the one thing that they really set out on the quest to do--save the world."
doc06265,book,train,"Surviving Hitler: A Boy in the Nazi Death CampThis book is a great pick to read to pre-teen to teenage students who are learning about the Holocaust. It is a story of a teenage boy living in Europe during the Holocaust and it follows his horrific journey through that unimaginably difficult time. The story of his time in the concentration camp paints a vivid picture of the awful things that went on. The detail of the pain and fear and courage that such a young man had to face will leave your heart forever changed. Teaching students about the Holocaust through the experiences of someone who survived it at their age is a great way of getting them interested in the history of the topic. Like with any book written about that time period, much of the information is very disturbing; but it is real and a part of history, therefor appropriate for young learners to read. I highly recommend this book to share with middle school and high school students to understand the tragedy of the Holocaust."

doc03844,book,valid,"Liad Shoham has been hailed as Israel's leading crime writer. In an essay published by the Jewish Telegraphic Agency, he said he based this, his first book to be published in English, on the real-life headlines of a Tel Aviv rape that went unsolved.There's certainly a lot of criminal procedure in this book which begins with aforesaid brutal rape of a young woman who is severely traumatized by the assault. When her father stakes out her apartment hoping the rapist might return to the scene of the crime, he sees someone who looks similar behaving suspiciously. That's enough for Detective Eli Nahum to bring in the suspect, Ziv Nevo, convinced that he's got his man.Nevo, who emerges as the nearest thing the book has to a hero, is involved in criminal activity. His life has gone off the rails and he's gotten mixed up with a mobster. But he's no rapist. Also involved in the plot are a young reporter and various members of the legal profession, both prosecutors and defense lawyers.Shoham is very good at describing the political pressures on the police and prosecutors to bring in a conviction, which leads them to blur the lines of procedure and cut corners. He's much less good when it comes to the world of the reporter.I enjoyed this book - but it has two major weaknesses. The protagonist, Nevo, for much of the volume is a weak, sniveling and rather creepy character, hard to get behind. The other main actor, Eli Nahum, is also flawed but not strongly enough drawn to make a really tragic hero in the mold let's say of Joe Nebo's Harry Hole. And the author doesn't manage to generate a lot of tension.The other problem is the resolution of the plot and unmasking of the rapist - which is not properly prepared and seems utterly unrealistic.I was struck by the fact that the book did not have a strong sense of local color. There is one foray to the West Bank but most of the action took place in Tel Aviv, which did not come across strongly as a backdrop. So what we have here is a highly competent procedural, marked by insight into the political world, but marred by a weak ending."

doc03612,book,valid,"Going from a gamer to a legendary king-in-the-making could have been a lot to handle for Artie Kingfisher. Instead, he traveled with ease back and forth between this world and the Otherworld all while retrieving Excalibur, setting Merlin free, ticking off Lordess Morgaine and inching one step closer to returning to Avalon. Of course, Artie also failed to save his friend Qwon from being captured, kind of lost the blade to Excalibur and isn't exactly sure what to do next. Nobody said becoming King Arthur was going to be a walk in the park.This much is true: Artie and his growing number of knights have less than 10 days to open the King's Gate at Avalon in order to completely reunite the two different worlds. If they fail, Artie will not become king, Lordess Morgraine will gain unspeakable power and Qwon could be lost forever. The only problem is that the only way to get to Avalon is to retrieve the Seven Swords, the seven most magical blades of the Dark Ages. And these swords can only be retrieved by their rightful owners. Oh, and Excalibur is currently in Lordess Morgraine's clutches. Ten days may not be enough time!With no time to waste, Artie, his sister Kay, and the rest of the knights set off to retrieve the swords. Along the way, they'll have to kidnap a future knight, travel to Sweden, France, and Japan and naturally, battle supernatural creatures that want to kill them. There's a reason the Seven Swords have remained hidden for so long, and it's not because no one has ever thought to go looking for them. One thing is for sure, Artie is going to have earn his crown the hard way. The original King Arthur would certainly approve.For her part, Qwon has tried to be a good prisoner. She's been cooped up with a fairy that could overpower anyone with its pungent smell, hasn't had much to eat and also wonders where in the world she is. Qwon has tried to make friends with her captor, Mordred, who happens to be Lordess Morgraine's son. For some reason, Qwon finds something familiar about Mordred, something that just might make the difference between Artie succeeding or failing in his quest to return to Avalon and unite the world and the Otherworld.The legend of King Arthur was far from boring, and author Johnson-Shelton has certainly succeeded in making the second installment in this re-creation action-packed. Since the first book, THE INVISIBLE TOWER, provided all the background information, it's time to focus on the good stuff. The battles are fierce and wild, the creatures mysterious and horrifying and the new schemes menacing and game-changing. Even good old Merlin seems to be hiding some important information, and his allegiance to Artie seems questionable at best. I believe that Artie just might make it to Avalon, but I'm just not sure how he's going to get there or what will happen along the way!Reviewed by Benjamin Boche"

No matter how many times he rejected her and told her NO she kept throwing herself at him and it was akward to read...until he gave in unsuprisingly when she gave herself to him.  It seemed he only married her out of pity and the fact that he thought he was dying and she was ok with that!  Desperate!  Lily was just everything you don't want to be as a woman.

doc01398,book,train,"As several reviewers have mentioned already, this title is essentially the same book as ""The Countess"".  There is very little new storyline to be had.  Same story line - different point of view, much as Julia Quinn attempted with Lost Duke and Mr. Cavendish.  Instead of combining the stories to make one passably interesting book, they were published as two dreadfully dull books that left a lot of readers feeling cheated.Bizarrely enough, this story could have actually worked if the characters did not come across as incredibly stupid. Sure, readers would have to check reality at the door, but there is the possibility of fun of a farcical nature.  Unfortunately, that possibility is lost when the characters combined IQs prove to be equivalent to a bag of hair.  There may as well be huge blinking neon arrows pointing to the ""clues"" (and the characters don't click) .  The mysterious villain is so obvious, this story begins to feel like a Nancy Drew novel written for pre-teens.  The really tragic part of all this is, while The Heiress is already an anemic copy of The Countess, readers are more than likely going to be treated to a third, even more diluted installment of this story when Lisa and Robert's story is released (with a possible match for the Madison father tossed in for good measure).  I'd say this title is a definite library check out (and even them you might feel like you've been cheated).  I found this type of writing in Quinn's work to be lazy and dull, and she has long since stopped being an author whose work I anticipate or purchase.  I am sorry to say, Lynsay Sands is joining that list, which is too bad.  I used to enjoy her stuff."
doc07633,book,train,"I spent a few weeks in Spain in the mid 90's and enjoyed it immensely. I also enjoyed the ""on the road"" show on PBS as it made me remember parts of my Spanish trip.This book is a very good representation of the show.And while they ate a lot of seafood on the show, and you tend to eat alot of seafood when you're in certain spots in Spain -- there's also a lot of fish in this book. Almost too much.Some of the recipes are interesting, but not much that you could or would want to pull off in your own kitchen.It's a good book about the quartet's Spanish adventure (I'm not sure why Mark and Claudia were not also brought in as co-writers) -- but if you're looking for a Espana cookbook, there are better options."
doc04029,book,train,"I wish author Wolfe had focused more on declassified FBI documents and interviews with surviving FBI officials like G. Gordon Liddy.  Wolfe promoted his book by appearing on Liddy's nationally broadcast radio show in 1998.  Liddy said on-air he recalled hearing talk at his federal agency of employment -- talk of the Kennedys passing Monroe back and forth.  She was alive when Liddy heard that in his office in Washington, DC.  So put a recording of it on You Tube, Mr. Wolfe!  Liddy's name isn't in the book.The federal prison sentence he served for his Watergate misdeeds doesn't disqualify his statements about 1962 any more than Sophia Loren's prison sentence for tax evasion undermines her published recollections of Marilyn looking lonely at a Hollywood party, year unknown.  &#34;I wish I had read poetry to her,&#34; said Ms. Loren (I'm paraphrasing) in the 1970s.  She never mentioned Norman Mailer's hints of a Kennedy connection.  She didn't witness what happened in the Brentwood section of Los Angeles on August 4-5, 1962, and neither did Mr. Liddy.  Let's hear from him for a change.The declassification of Monroe's FBI documents started many years before Wolfe started working on his book.  He should have focused on them, not the evils of the Communist Party.  He never explains what connection there was, if any, between the Kennedys' political damage control and the Communist Party-inspired surveillance of Monroe by Dr. Ralph Greenson, Dr. Hyman Engelberg and Eunice Murray.Maybe there wasn't a connection. Then say there wasn't!  Wolfe's theory is (unless his jumble of doctors, Murray and public relations liars have confused me hopelessly) that Dr. Greenson happened to inject his psychiatric patient with the wrong resuscitation medicine between her ribs without his knowing that approximately two hours earlier LAPD intelligence operative James Hamilton had given her a sedative with instructions from Robert Kennedy who accompanied him to her house.Alright then, please say Dr. Greenson made a medical mistake and was ignorant of the sedative that was already in her bloodstream.  Go ahead and say it.  And please explain what the Communist Party memberships of Dr. Greenson, Dr. Engelberg, Eunice Murray, her husband who died in 1958, Lee Strasberg and Paula Strasberg had to do with the doctor's needle &#34;accidentally&#34; hitting the wrong place in her ribcage.Unless you fill in those blanks, then a writer inspired by the Ladies' Home Journal is going to repeat the same fifty-year-old propaganda: &#34;Marilyn gazed admiringly at every new man who entered the room where she was emoting.  She gazed admiringly because she was hoping her father would do this or that ... Hollywood used her then killed her. ... Every paunchy producer fantasized about her more often than he lit a new cigar. ... Then came the unhappily married White House couple who avoided mentioning 'the other woman.' ... Marilyn stayed up all night wondering where to find her metaphorical father. ... The pills offered a respite from her endless searching ... Focus on the White House prince and princess ...  Forget about men who worked for other federal agencies. They were boring.  Some were known as bores and eggheads.  The Ladies' Home Journal doesn't want them.  Maybe talk about their wives who were soccer moms before the SUV was invented ... They had Country Squire station wagons... June Cleaver was the anti-Marilyn ... Want to live to be 94 years old as did Barbara Billingsley?  Then aspire to be a soccer mom, not a Hollywood starlet searching for a father ...&#34;You don't like that stuff from the Ladies' Home Journal?  Then fill in the blanks in the masculine conspiracy theory.  Author Donald Wolfe must do that.  He has participated in several TV documentaries, doing some of them many years after the 1998 publication of his book in hardback.  He never mentions the FBI documents or G. Gordon Liddy.  Wolfe turned 81 recently.  Liddy is 82.  Get to it.Otherwise, say hello again to the paunchy Hollywood producer (Lester Cowan?) lighting his cigar and glaring at the starlet who can satisfy his needs both professional and personal.  Say hello again to the Hollywood &#34;them,&#34; represented by him.  They killed her.  He wants excitement now that his wife has become a boring soccer mom.  They killed her.  He wants excitement now that his wife has become a boring soccer mom.  They killed her. ...  Are you now or have you ever been a member of the Communist Party?  Pay attention to the Hollywood &#34;them,&#34; not the &#34;Hollywood Ten.&#34;All of this is enough to make you watch hundreds of reruns of Goodson-Todman game shows so you can look for sanity in midtown Manhattan back in the day.  Then those reruns become monotonous and not necessarily 100 percent genuine.  Did John Daly walk out on his wife and kids or was that Garry Moore?  You can see it in his eyes.  Who died from cigarette smoking?  Bloggers love that stuff, but it becomes monotonous and one-dimensional.  Oh well, live in the present. We have surveillance video.  Nobody can destroy cell phone surveillance as somebody did to Marilyn's private conversations."

doc05284,book,valid,"It's an engaging read, recommended to those interested in Greek or Trojan mythology. That being said, there are countless interpretations of the Iliad, and it may be unfair to expect it to do something that hasn't been done before. It's not a retelling. It rarely strays from the original story, but will be a good introduction to the myth.What I didn't like: Flitting tenses are annoying, but that's just me. Patroclus's narration is often maudlin and he seems infatuated with Achilles and absurdly unaware of his own potential, until the moment it's revealed to us (surprise!) that Patroclus is the best of the Myrmidons. Patroclus's descriptions of Achilles are garish and repetitive, and the love scenes are sometimes laughably awkward. At some of the key moments, the purple prose strives to invoke a reaction and we lose the profound simplicity such scenes demand.What I liked: The Song of Achilles is aptly titled and looks at Achilles in all his glory and terror with an unbiased honesty, that only a lover can show. The story and the point of view turns the hero or the villain, as he's bound to be either extreme in most interpretations of the myth, into a person. The characters of this book are charmingly fleshed out, my favourites are Odysseus, Thetis and Briseis. The floweriness of Patroclus's descriptions doesn't extend to the dialogue, which has a good flow and gives each character his distinct voice.The all encompassing quality of this book makes it special. It strings together countless stories of all the men of Greece and Ilium and all the Olympian gods, capturing the essence of an epic. It's clear that a lot of research went into this book, and that makes the absence of information dumps all the better.From the very first page, beginning with Patroclus's first person narration, I wondered what would happen after he died. It would be weird if the narrative just stopped after Hector killed Patroclus and the book ended with Hector still alive. No book about Achilles would skip his final revenge. And a shift in point of view so close to the end would be too jarring. So what Miller's done is use a risky literary device and let the unburied spirit of Patroclus shadow the rest of the war, invisibly watching Achilles's death and the fall of Troy. It sounds hard to pull off, and seems too contrived at first, but the ghost-narration is wonderfully executed and the book ends on an impossibly happy note."

Antonia Juhasz has written an incredible economic chronology on White House relations with the Mid-East and what we can expect in the future. It prompts an ""I don't believe it"" reaction again and again, page after page. Our involvement in Iraq, she says, is really is about an economics foreign policy that will ultimately result in MEFTA. [Remember ""NAFTA""?] It's not a quick read as it is extraordinarily fact-filled, information-packed, and seems vastly credible in its perspective as to what the administration, big corporations and our military are up to. The book is not at all a politico hack-job on GWB & Co. but does provide clear answers to any questions the reader may have had about: ""Why are we over there?""

doc03275,book,train,"I'll readily admit that I did not and do not agree with Mr. Lott on most issues. However, I am also aware that sound-bites can (and do) prevent the real person from coming through sometimes. After reading this book, I am convinced that Trent Lott is in fact a man who holds vendettas against the people he disagrees with.In addition to liberal Democrats like me, Mr. Lott is also comfortable attacking the most conservative members of his own Republican party. Unless things are being done according to his specifications, Lott is going to get mad at them. No longer having to count on them for 'favors' he is now free to let the fur fly in this scathing memoir.For all of his years on the ""Hill"" Lott refused to believe that a Republican White House would not necessarily agree with him and the Senate on all of the issues either. They have their own political hides to worry about and providing coattails is an 'extra' service, when times get tough they are the first thing pulled up.  Lott forgot to check the White House Senate relations when the Republicans had briefly held the Senate during the Reagan administration. A little thought goes a long way in the political arena.Because the GOP was trying to increase the number of African American voters, other Republican Senators and the president promptly declined to support Lott---instead pressing for his resignation. Lott could not bring himself to concede how his own actions threatened to undercut the `compassionate conservatism' message which was carefully crafted by GOP spin doctors.Lott is upset that he is no longer the Senate majority leader and it went to somebody other than himself. I don't think his outrage is directed against the current leader Bill Frist (TN) as a person, it's just that 'Trent Lott is not calling the shots anymore' and he's still harboring hurt feelings over that loss of power.Anybody could have assumed the Majority Leader position following his resignation and Lott would have found something intrinsically wrong with them---just because they weren't him!Separating this book from good political memoirs (such as those by Bush Sr.) Lott fails to assume total responsibility for his own leadership loss, and does not provide a book reflecting the real breadth of his career in federal politics. Considering how long he served I honestly believe that many more things were left out of the manuscript for this book. It does not read like the work of a person who was an epicenter for the Republican Party."

doc06137,book,valid,"I'm coming at this review knowing that I'm not really wearing the same rose-colored glasses as some other reviewers.  I am (obviously) not in the right demographic to truly appreciate this book, but neither was my daughter.  She is four and this was just too far above her head (school references don't register with her) and I found myself reading the book to myself, considering that my daughter's eyes would glaze over after a few pages as her attention fled from the book and fell upon some random toy that provided more immediate enjoyment.  I tried spreading it out, but the story didn't capture her and I found myself reading more age appropriate books to her.But, since I have this thing about reviewing a product that I myself have not finished, I read the rest of the book to myself.As a whole, the book is cute, but I agree with those who argue that this isn't really anything special.  The story is decent, but nothing more than that.  The character of Cinderella (nickname) is spunky and memorable and I'd love to see her character explored deeper in a more eventful prose, but there was something limited about this book.It felt bland in a way.Cinderella Smith is a character that needs her own cartoon though, because she has the potential to flood our television sets with adventures that I'm sure my daughter would love to see.  On the printed page though, this falls a little flat.  The lifeless illustrations don't help either.  They feel cheap and take away from the spunk that the character is attempting to portray.  It appears to be rather unpopular to go against the grain here and voice anything but praise, but I can't wholeheartedly praise this book.  It has its moments, but at the end of the day it is rather forgettable."
doc06840,book,train,"This is the first book I have ever read by Ralph Nader.  I never expected to buy and read this book, but I heard a very short interview with Nader on TV in which he mentioned something about his book that caught my attention.  On a whim I bought it and I was quite impressed by the simple intelligence that went into writing it.  Nader's writing is smart without being in any way pretentious.We all know (or think we know) who Ralph Nader is, and might be inclined to expect a ""cause"" book from him.  But there is much at work here.  This is a smart autobiography written by a private man who is looking back on his childhood.  But rather than construct a temporal narrative (""I was born in ...""), Nader tries to recall 17 memorable traditions, values, or ethical practices that were a part of his childhood (family meals, learning to listen, education, discipline, etc) and describes how he learned each one and how it contributed to his moral formation.While this is not a political book, Nader has a strongly hinted view about where we have come from, who we are, and where we appear to be headed.  Nader observes, with a lifetime of experience and insight, that, in the moral, inner life of American society, we have not only not succeeded entirely in defeating the evils of Nader's childhood, but we are also in danger of abandoning or losing so much of what was good.  This short reflection on a life lived is a significant contribution in the conversation that leads to stopping and reversing that trend.

doc06851,book,valid,"The Way to a Duke's Heart is the final book in the The Truth About the Duke trilogy and a fun, charming story. Scandal, mystery, romance and blackmail make up this tale, and I enjoyed every minute of it! This is my first taste of Caroline Linden's writing and a truly pleasant experience. The characters, their lives and circumstances, kept me invested and wanting to know more about them, especially the scandal surrounding Charles' rightful - or not - claim to the Dukedom.And speaking of Charles, I found him to be clever, insightful, immensely charming, and most definitely sexy, too! But aside from all this, I think what I loved most about him were his insecurities and uncertainties because they made him an imperfect hero, one I wanted to bring home and love until he could see in himself the man that I saw in him! Charismatic, flawed, honorable and sexy... Charles is the kind of hero I love in my historical romance reads.Tessa is a truly great heroine, one I felt connected to early on. Unconventional, independent, compassionate and loving, she might have been stubborn but she was never annoying - okay, maybe occasionally annoying, but nothing I couldn't cope with! She felt deep love for her family, and shame for what she had put them through, and so she spent her life trying to prove herself and win back their respect. I loved this about her! She didn't whimper and whine about the things that had happened. There was no ""Woe is me!"" simpering. She knew what had to be done and then set about putting everything to rights, thus restoring her family's faith in her! Though I have to say, I'm not entirely sure she had ever truly lost it.In addition to the wonderful leading couple, there was an awesome supporting cast, but my favorite was Tessa's clever, elderly companion, Eugenie, who stole the show a time or two.Before closing, I want to reiterate - Although this is the third book of the trilogy, it really does work well as a standalone. Ms. Linden did a fabulous job giving us the back-story without it feeling forced or dictated. That said, I will most definitely be reading the prequel, I Love the Earl and the first two full length novels, One Night in London and Blame it on Bath, and look forward to reading more by this very talented author!The bottom line: While there were areas the story lagged a bit, The Way to a Duke's Heart is a brilliant work of twists and turns that never felt contrived or predictable. I'm very impressed that, although I hadn't read the first two books, I never felt lost or as if I had missed something. The relationship and the romance built at a comfortable pace and I found myself cheering for Charles' and Tessa's happily ever after and when they reached it, knowing it was a love meant to be."
doc07880,book,valid,"As much as I enjoyed the The Mysterious Howling (the first book of The Incorrigible Children of Ashton Place series), the The Hidden Gallery is even better. Wood made this second book in the series of three more enticing, mysterious, and fun.The Hidden Gallery picks up where The Mysterious Howling left off. For readers who might not have read the first book (I recommend that you do), Wood quickly brings them up to date with what has transpired and fills in details throughout the story without slowing down the pace. Her writing is delightful. She stops periodically to explain terminology, colloquialisms, and share wisdom with the reader--a wonderful idea, since it adds to the richness of the story itself and the experience of being mesmerized and drawn in deeper to the story. It is as though Wood is telling the story directly to the reader and then stopping to make sure they are still following her. Not breaking her stride, she jumps back into her magnificent storytelling.Wood adds more dimension to her story lines with a change of scenery (London) and the introduction of new, interesting, and flawed characters. She builds more mystery through clues and starts to flesh out her primary characters--Alexander, Beowulf, Cassiopeia (the Incorrigibles) and Miss Penelope Lumley (the Incorrigibles' governess). Things are not what they seem and the reader will have to wait until Wood's third book to get all of the answers. There's more to come from the gypsy fortune-teller, Judge Quinzy, Lord Frederick, Miss Charlotte Mortimer (the former headmistress of The Swanburne Academy for Poor Bright Females, from which Miss Penelope Lumley came), and the apparently unhelpful Hixby's Lavishly Illustrated Guide to London: Compleat with Historical Reference, Architectural Significance, and Literary Illusions.by Judy Millerfor Story Circle Book Reviewsreviewing books by, for, and about women"

After slogging through the first several Allingham entries, decided to switch off for a while and tackle some more later. For me, her stories have been so encumbered with difficult and now obscure British dialect as to wear one out trying to mine the story.  This first Marsh entry was thus quite refreshing with its entirely more readable aspect and simplicity of language. While it is somewhat redundant in its oft-repeated English country house weekend format, it is an encouraging start to the writer's series.  I sincerely look forward to succeeding editions."

Ms. Long writes well and has a unique style of writing -- different, but refreshing and seems to fit the period somehow.  Anyway, I read this book right after I had finished a second reading of Julie Garwood's ""Ransom"", which is a tough act to follow.  In fairness, I try not to compare.The story had a slow start, but seemed to pick up (past midway point)after Duke Alex Moncrieffe and Genevieve had their first intimate encounter.  Through richer dialogue I was better able to understand who they really were and thus to care about them...to feel.  Admittedly, I understood and cared more for the hero and in some ways believed he deserved a better heroine.  Or at least wished to learn more about her, so I could sense the chemistry a bit more.  Too much was made of his age, so the contrast between age differences was foremost on my mind and played a role in my truly viewing them as a viable couple.  And Genevieve went from being certain of her love for Harry to her love for Alex in short a time span.  I wished the author had developed this part a bit more, so the reader could see the transformation.Nevertheless, it was an enjoyable read.  And I would recommend it, despite the flaws I noted.  (P.S. I also agree that the Kindle price is a bit high/overpriced!)"

Her mother has always told her not to end up like her sister, but when two pink lines appear on a pregnancy test, Miranda's perfect daughter act is up. Her boyfriend has left her for her best friend, who might not really be a friend at all, she ditched her former best friend and now she won't talk to her, and all Miranda wants is her sister to help her through it all. Miranda searches for more about her sister's past and in the process finds out secrets about her sister-and discovers some she was hiding from herself.GreenBeanTeenQueen Says: I wasn't sure what to think of Tell Me a Secret. It combines two big topics familiar to ""issue novels""-dead sibling lit and teen pregnancy lit-and how exactly were these two going to work together? At first I wasn't sure where the book was taking me-the first couple of chapters left me feeling lost and I was sure if it was past or present, but I soon got the feel of the book which alternates between flashbacks and present day to tell the whole story.My heart broke for Miranda. She's so lost and lonely and some of the choices she makes-namely her friendships-are so horrible to read about. You know she's traveling down a bad path, but she doesn't and it's hard to read about it. You want to reach in and warn her and hug her and help her see the truth. And her mother is one of the worst mother's I have read about-she's awful which made scenes with her hard to get through. It did give the book an interesting twist, with the father as the submissive one and the mother the stronger parent who is feared.There were moments of this book that were so emotionally heartbreaking that I had to pull myself away for a moment. I had to take a few days after I read it to full digest the whole book too. It's an emotional read but also not so emotional that it's hard to read. There's hope and that's what I love about YA-even when life is at it's bleakest, there's hope and that shows through in YA novels more than any adult book I've read.I thought the story was going to be predictable and I thought I knew where things were going. And while I had some things figured out, other's I didn't, so I was glad that the author could keep me guessing. I did feel like I would have liked to know more about Xanda, Miranda's sister, but I guess we got what we needed to know about her and this to be Miranda's story. I also had a hard time forgiving some of the characters, but was glad to see that things were trying to work out. I did like that the ending is not a nice tidy little bow-this is realistic fiction and there are consequences to Miranda's choices. It does end happier than it could have, but I didn't think it felt like an out of place fairy tale ending.I plan to give Tell Me A Secret to my teens who ask for realistic fiction-I think the story will be something they'll be excited about. I would love to pair it with The Sky Is Everywhere for a book discussion or lit circle. It'd be interesting to look at how the two main characters handle grief."

doc04501,book,valid,"Jeff Brown's Invisible Stanley is part of a series of adventures revolving a boy called Stanley Lambchop and the rest of his family.  I haven't read the others in the series myself, but possibly you'd get more out of this and even rate it higher if you have done so.  Invisible Stanley for kids who just come across it, or for those adults like me who simply read everything in the invisible man genre can be read and fully understood as a standalone story. It does give away the plots of previous adventures, particularly one where Stanley got flattened so may take away the enjoyment of previous books if those are read later.  Overall it's a simple pleasant to read story where Stanley although not liking the fact he is now suffering from invisibility, doesn't let it hinder his enjoyment of life and takes being invisible not only in his stride, but uses it to help strangers as well as lift his brother's self esteem.Comparing Invisible Stanley to other invisibility books, it's a bit weak on the method of becoming invisible.  In this one Stanley becomes invisible simply due to eating fruit while a thunderstorm is raging outside, which is apparently a documented medical occurrence by others as well. In fact no one is ever freaked out encountering an invisible boy. This book also has not only the clothing becoming transparent that Stanley was wearing at the time he became invisible, but also any other clothing he puts on later as well, meaning the plot doesn't have to tackle the problems of floating clothes or the embarrassment of needing to be naked to not be seen. Stanley actually walks around holding a balloon with his face drawn on it so other characters know where he is, (as well as the reader, as the book is illustrated with black and white illustrations done in the same style as the cover). On page 10 we're told the string of the balloon vanishes, however the illustrations contradict this with the string clearly visible all the time. The target market age group for this story however probably won't care too much about those things, but fans of the invisible man genre might.Years ago I created a Listmania list on the best invisible man/woman/child fiction out there, but Amazon has made it hard to find Listmania lists these days.

The first half of the book focuses on many  characters who are not even related to the main theme of the book participating in a murder mystery.  It feels like the author wanted to write two books, and put them together in this- and it doesn't ""flow"" very well.  It's hard to follow the characters at the beginning and leads to disinterest.The 2nd half of the book is much more like the previous books I'd read by Elizabeth Young and I quickly got into it then.

doc03551,book,valid,"This is a book that is very strongly influenced by the Jesus Seminar and the Gospel of Thomas. Written in a simplified manner, it discusses the 'true mission' of Jesus, drawing on the 'Q' document as a gospel.  He discusses various aspects of Jesus, such as Jesus was probably illiterate, Paul was more learned than Jesus because he drew on the OT & greek writers more than he did, the miracles are wrongly emphasized to make theological points, son of man REALLY should be son of humanity (human being), Nazareth in Aramaic is really Nazara, etc. But despite this latest disputed view of the gospel taken as objectivity, he draws some good distinctions about the message of Jesus verses the story about Jesus. He just does this so, SO slowly, unraveling the myth of Jesus to get to how his message can impact your life, that I almost abandoned the book. Perhaps not to offend the potential believer reading his book? The author knows this because in the last chapter he begins with ""First let me express appreciation to those of you who have gotten this far - you are really here! Not everyone made it - you are the hardy ones.""The author tries to strike a balance between the evangical Christian and the agostic secular Christian in his dissection of Jesus. This made me feel at times like...does he know who he is writing for? I get by the end the author must be a Unitarian, and Jesus was one too!Because the Jesus Seminar without even mentioning it, had a strong impact on the book and it is taken as definative, I feel a bit deceived. For example the author tosses out at one point that the gospel writers drew inspiration from the OT for the Jesus narratives, yet does not elaborate on the point as to why he thinks that is? The idea vanishes as quickly as it appeared. This and other points stick out when reading it, so it spoiled the few gems of the work. For me, just reading the introduction (a summary of jesus' message) would have been sufficient."

While at first the story seems slow and without direction, once Diana Wynne Jones introduces the idea of counterparts, the story starts to fall together.  The reader learns as Andrew learns (or rather remembers) the magic that his grandfather had taught him all those years ago.The way Diana Wynne Jones slowly brings the reader to realize what she is referring to throughout her story is well done and fun.

doc04722,book,train,"This book is a record of a long journey the author took through China in the mid-1980s.  Before embarking, Thubron took an intensive course in Mandarin back in his native England.  This enabled him to converse with the people he met he met on his trip without having to resort to translators or guesswork.  Thubron met people from all walks of life--professors, students, doctors, bureaucrats, and peasants.  His trip took him from one side of the country to the other.Thubron enjoys language, and seems to go out of his way to find specific descriptive terms for all he sees.  Sometimes he goes a little too far out of his way, like when he describes some Beijing apartment blocks as ""tundra-like"", leaving the reader wondering what in the world he had in mind, or whether this was just a random choice of words.  But for the most part, his use of vocabulary makes his descriptions come to life.  Thubron was not greatly enamored with China; he is ready to find the bad along with the good, and his attitude at times can come across as a bit too negative.  Nevertheless, the book provides an interesting glimpse of what a British traveler found in China some 10 years after Mao's passing."

While Geek Girls Unite did this to an extent, I felt that this book was kind of stereotypic as well as surface-level.  It wasn't nearly as clever as a book on geekiness should be.One of the major things that bothered me about Geek Girls Unite was that it seems to cater to those who are just one-dimensional geeks (and I say that in the most loving way), but most geeks don't just fit into one mold. Not all geeks are solely computer/technology geeks, math geeks, music geeks, film geeks, or book geeks, but rather are two or more of these things.  Surprising as it may seem, people can be wildly passionate about two or more things.  I, for one, cagetorize myself as both a literature geek AND a music geek.  I don't get why you would have to be one or the other.So, if you're looking for a fluffy, cute, and somewhat stereotypic look at geekiness, pick up Geek Girls Unite.

doc03843,book,train,"I was definitely a fan of Cold Kiss, it was different and genuine and I really liked the characters, so when I heard there would be a sequel, I knew I had to give it a read. Turns out there wasn't really a point to having a sequel. The word I would best use to describe Glass Heart is subtle. Everything was pretty low-key, in that nothing jumped out to me as exciting or riveting, but then again, it's not like I didn't like the book and the pacing was steady enough which allowed me to finish it pretty quickly. It was great to see all the characters again and to get a better understanding of Wren's history, but I felt that with the way Amy handled the story, it could've easily been included in the first novel.In Glass Heart, Wren is having fun with her powers and enjoying the freedom to use it whenever she wants, but she has to deal with the fact that Gabriel isn't too happy with her doing so because he's worried that bad things can happen. Of course Wren is rebellious and stubborn and set on doing things her own way, which leads to her run with a different kind of crowd that hiding a dark and twisted past.Wren's character matures and develops throughout this book and I think that's pretty much the basis of the entire story. I couldn't really connect with her this time around and often times thought her to be a bit too whiney and short-tempered, especially when it came to Gabriel and his issues with her powers. There also wasn't really as much of Gabriel as I would've liked. And if you read Cold Kiss, you'd guess Wren's father would play a big role in Glass Heart, but really, his part wasn't as important or as big as I expected. I feel like Amy simply touched base with all the aspects of Wren's life that happens after the whole ""Danny incident"" so readers would see what her life is like now, but then she doesn't add enough detail, often times going off on tangents, and some moments were a bit too choppy for my liking.Probably the worst part for me was the ending. It felt very rushed and underdeveloped for me, as with much of the entire book, I'm afraid. The ending was pretty much anti-climatactic and a bit disappointing. I was expecting more resolution, but Amy leaves things pretty wide open and I don't know if she means for readers to interpret things on their own, or if she's leaving room for herself in case she wants to write more of Wren's story.I know I'm pointing out a lot of the negatives, but don't get me wrong, I liked Glass Heart, just not as much as I had hoped. Yes, there were choppy moments and times when I wished Amy would've elaborated on more important details rather than fill it up with trivial moments, but she kept the story going and it's not like I was bored at all while reading this. I don't know if I'd consider it much of sequel as far as sequels tend to go, but it's a nice story if anyone's wondering what's up with Wren after Danny."

I hadn't, and I wasn't. I loved reading this book the way I have loved reading every book starring Vicky and John, because Elizabeth Peters has done such a good job of making me know and love and care deeply about her characters.Even after more than ten years, Peters still writes those characters perfectly. She also recreated their world (albeit a modern version of it) and their lives down to the details--the thrillingly epic, the hilariously mundane, and the way that the larger-than-life has become routine for them while the frustrations of daily life can be often be dramatic--that we enjoy so much. She recreated Vicky's voice equally well. As always, there are one liners and bits of repartee that make me laugh out loud and want to bookmark the pages where they live, there are impassioned and touching declarations, and there are those thoughts that Vicky shares about life that I identify with so wholly.The book is not perfect, of course. There are times when the pacing slows a bit, and there are a couple of instances of repetitiveness that some readers have put down to bad editing. However, this book is written in the first person; we hear what Vicky thinks. I don't think that it even calls for a serious suspension of disbelief to suppose that a subject of thought might occur to someone twice over a period of several days.Some readers of mysteries may be troubled to find that they can identify characters or pick out some of the bad guys before their revelation to the sleuths--but for this series, in which there are recurring heroes and villains, this is in many ways a game that is played with the readers. Some of the revelations in this book have been speculated about and discussed by many fans for some time, but it was still a pleasure to find them out for certain.Although I read this book in fewer than 24 hours, the pace of my reading did slow down near the end, because I realized that with every page I read, there was one fewer new page of Vicky. I knew I could only read new pages once, and that the remaining pages might be the last new pages of Vicky ever. Despite the sadness of that thought, I still thoroughly enjoyed all the pages, especially the last two or three, which not only made me grin, as they did Vicky, ""a big, silly grin,"" but made me laugh and made me exult (if such a thing is possible).This is not my favorite Vicky--that will always beNight Train to Memphis (Vicky Bliss Mysteries)--and it may not be the best (although I'm not sure I could determine which one is), but it fits right into the series without a problem, and if it is the last one, although I shall miss the characters dreadfully, it is a fitting end.A favorite quote, from p. 229: ""Only Schmidt, the bloody romantic, spoke up in John's defense.

doc07696,book,valid,"CHANGO'S FIRE by Ernesto QuinonezFebruary 26, 2005I found CHANGO'S FIRE by Ernesto Quinonez a rather unusual novel.  Julio Santana is of Puerto Rican descent, living in Spanish Harlem.  He makes a living in construction, but at the same time he's also being paid to burn down buildings, as part of an insurance scam.  He makes good money, people get their insurance money, and everyone is happy.  But Julio is tired of the lies and the destruction, and wants out.  He goes to school at night to better himself, and tells his ""boss"", Eddie, that he has done his last building and refuses to burn another. Eddie, however, isn't too happy about Julio's plans, and threatens him.While this is one theme in CHANGO'S FIRE, there are other things that are going on while Julio tries to change his life. There are many colorful characters that reside in Julio's neighborhood, and many are trying to make a change for the better.  There's Maritza, the radical crazy lady that runs a church to spout off her political beliefs.  She hands out condoms and teaches the immigrants about abortion and birth control. There's Papelito, the (...) Santero priest, who is also trying to help those in the neighborhood that come to him. And there is Helen, who Julio finds a deep attraction for, maybe because she is not of this neighborhood and is someone that represents something that is out of reach for him, because of his color.CHANGO'S FIRE was not an easy read.  The themes in the book were rather complex, and of a nature that some may not care to read about.  I found the character of Julio quite a departure from the type of persons I read about in fiction, and questioned often if what he did for a living truly happens?  Arson is nothing new, but to read about it as if it was someone's every day job felt very different from what I know in my own world.  I think that is why this book will probably stand out for me for a long time.  I'm giving this book four stars, but I don't recommend the book to everyone.  It's not your every day average read."

doc06652,book,valid,"Sometimes you read a lot of books that just kind of blur together. Other times you read something like Soul Enchilada. I have to tell you, even when the plot showed traces of strain in spots, I didn't care. Bug Smoot is quite simply one of the most real, funny, gutsy, and poignant characters I've met in a long time. And the other characters are dimensional, amusing, and colorful in their own right.The plot of Soul Enchilada reaches out and grabs you by the lapels, too. Here's a nice hypothetical: What do you do when the repo man comes, and he's a devil? Oh, and he tells you that your recently deceased grandfather traded his soul for the Caddy that's your only inheritance, the one you're driving to deliver pizzas and barely make your rent? But since your grandfather managed to evade the repo man when he died, you're left holding the hell bag. And senior demon Mr. Beals is not just after the car.There are more twists and turns along the way in this remarkable Tex-Mex debut, but suffice it to say that Bug (who is half black, half Latino) gets some help from a demon-hunting Latino boy named Pesto who wields a mean can of hair spray. She is also assisted by a mysterious coyote, some nerdy Men in Black types, a lawyer with a secret agenda, Pesto's bruja mother, and her own mad driving and basketball skills. Numerous crosses and double crosses later--including a little diablo ex machina--Bug wins the day. In terms of plotting, I found the climactic scenes a little off, but this author's ""off"" still beats most writers' ""on"" any time.I haven't even talked about Gill's style, especially the way he writes narrator Bug's voice. Here are a few of my favorite bits:""'Stop tea-bagging my body,' said the first guy, who had long, stringy blond hair and a head shaped like the center branch of a saguaro cactus.""""'I so owned you. In fact, I pawned you.' The second guy had a gut like a pregnant woman and a black, lower-lip beard.""""The only time I ever messed around with a s&eacute;ance was when me and Papa C were staying in this falling-down rental house in Chihuahiuta, and these skanky girls next door said they could do voodoo. There wasn't nothing in the Bible about suffering voodoo, so I snuck out at night to a shed in the back of their house.They brought a candle, a Monopoly set, and a parakeet. The candle was for light so spirits could find their way, and the Monopoly board was our Ouija board because their mama wouldn't let them buy one at the SuperStore. They had a parakeet because you needed a chicken's foot to do voodoo, and they didn't have a chicken. The parakeet was their mama's, and she'd get mad if its foot went missing, so they brought the whole bird, chirping and pecking them whenever it could. I was glad they didn't chop off the foot because I didn't like the idea of hurting a living thing, even to do voodoo.""""'I wish you was an alarm clock so I could slap your snooze bar.'""""My tongue was all sticky, too, like the floor of a dollar movie theatre.""I hope I've convinced you to spend some time with Bug Smoot. Her flaws are just as delightful as her strengths, and I think you'll find that you're cheering her on and booing Mr. Beals far more than the hero/villain/reader triangle traditionally calls for."

doc07794,book,train,"One of four Poirot classics in exotic locations (the others being Murder on the Orient Express, Death on the Nile, and Evil Under the Sun), Appointment with Death stands out as that with the most memorable plot.  Among the Boynton children, everyone is a suspect, everyone lies, and it is up to Poirot to find the innocent.  A crime in the rock city of Petra, in broad daylight, raises a most eerie feeling.  Logically, the plot is most complex, where the same few events can be shuffled into so many permutations, only one of which can be true.The reason I did not give it 5 stars is the built in racism in some of the statements.  I cannot be sure whether that is a reflection of Agatha's on racism towards browner people, or merely an accurate caricature of the British people of her time.  Examples are references to Petra as a ""natural wonder"", as if the massive stone monuments are carved into precise architectural shapes by the forces of nature, rather than the ingenuity of the ""natives"".  Other example are the constant annoyance of her characters by the lamentations of the Arab tour guides about Jewish immigration to Palestine, a real problem in 1938, in which the British government has played a central role.  By dismissing the opinions of the Arabs in such jest, Agatha missed an opportunity to document what has continued to be, to this day, the root of many problems in the Middle East.Still, Appointment with Death is a masterpiece that is a product of its time."

doc02226,book,train,"Compared to UNTIE MY HEART (2002), Judith Ivory elects to write about a novel more epic in scope with ANGEL IN A RED DRESS (2006) accompanied by a particularly strong historical backdrop: the French Revolution. The evolution in the strength of Judith Ivory's writing and prose shows, with a continued attention to setting the scene. She does it very smoothly as the mood and disposition of the characters and/or story impact the surroundings at a given moment in time (and vice-versa). For example, the hero Adrien impinging on a room's smell and accommodations.Unfortunately for me however, I did not enjoy the story and found characters tough to swallow in this grand 458-page paperback spanning over nine months (discounting the prologue). This book would receive 1 star if not for Judith Ivory's markedly strong prose and writing. I thought the book flailed around impotently for more than 200 pages in the beginning, really not finding its drive until the second part. Then, once we reach the impetus of the novel by the end of the first part (Shadows in the Sun), it fizzles out for more than 2-3 chapters in the following second part (Shadows in the Shade).The story is mostly about 35 year-old Adrien & 23 year-old Christina's ""romance."" The divorced Christina starts out as Adrien's mistress and finds herself unwittingly in the middle of Adrien's surreptitious operations. Adrien's secret operation involves rescuing French aristocrats from the guillotine and smuggling them into England during the French Revolution. The first part takes place in England, the second in France, and finally the brief and torturous (literally) third part (Shadows in the Dark) ends in England. All in all, it wasn't fun nor engaging, and although I did enjoy the history Ivory deftly intermingles into the story, I found Adrien and Christina's characterizations often times unbearable. The characterization of notorious libertine Adrien Hunt is completely over-the-top, too fantastical, while the characterization of Christina Bower Pinn too subservient, lacking in self-respect. Yeah, I couldn't overcome the suspension-of-disbelief factor where Adrien was concerned, the entire notion of his character was ludicrous. Again, story & characters: bleh.Like UNTIE MY HEART, the ending here was once again abrupt for a book not in a hurry at all! In fact, the ending in ANGEL IN A RED DRESS is worse than UNTIE MY HEART. The love scenes are sparse and light, the sensuality and passion not the strongest either if that's what you're looking for.I didn't quite grasp the reasoning behind the title of this book, it isn't really about the heroine Christina. ANGEL IN A RED DRESS firmly belongs to its hero Adrien down to every word on every page. At one point, a besotted stable boy comforts the beautiful heroine Christina, calling her an angel while she publicly parades around as Adrien's mistress. I suppose that scene gives the book its title along with an emblematic red scarf. However, the larger-than-life character of Adrien Hunt overshadows and clouds the story and all other characters including his heroine Christina.The story.Christina Bower's self-made rich father is a rising barrister on the King's bench, and he longs for a title for his grandchildren. After a brief meeting with the notorious libertine the Earl of Kewischester Adrien Hunt, Christina weds Richard Pinn at her father's behest. Only to have Richard Pinn divorce her three years later for not producing an heir and the mounting evidence of Christina's sterility.Thirty-five year-old Adrien Hunt, the Earl of Kewischester, thrives as a notorious libertine, and he's already fathered 5 bastard children. At one point in the novel, Christina's best friend Evie notes there isn't a woman within miles of the earl's Kewischester estate at Hampshire that doesn't know the earl intimately. In fact Christina's (married) best friend also admits sleeping with the earl a few years back! UNTIE MY HEART's hero had a harem too. Ivory certainly relishes on detailing her heroes' experience.Ivory packs too many layers onto her hero Adrien. He's the scheming, cunning sailor, the pompous, powerful earl, the Madman, the licentious libertine, the brilliant botanist, the articulate French poet, the lucky leprechaun, the industrious, wealthy entrepreneur, the invincible survivor conquering certain death time and time again, the affectionate father, the outlandish, preening dandy and lord knows what other layer I'm missing. The end result? Too fantastic, too nonsensical, but that may be Ivory's intent, and the attraction for many historical romance heroines: layers upon layers upon layers of trophies added on to Adrien's characterization. After the first 3-4 layers, the next and the next and the next become so frivolous, so meaningless, it's quite preposterous. There's no way to relate to Adrien Hunt, no way to ground him, except from the eyes of his enamored heroine Christina.Adrien is a regular energizer bunny, takes a lickin' and keeps on tickin'!The story continues on as the French authorities and the British prime minister are after this Madman rescuing French aristocrats from the guillotine while the Madman (Adrien) juggles them all.Overall, I found the book too girlish, Christina constantly in a state of swooning stupor around Adrien. Too many avid descriptions of the hero without really adding much: tall, dark, handsome, sensual, brooding, attractive, invincible, lucky, cunning, powerful, attractively arrogant, wealthy, affectionate, flexing muscles, yes, yes we get it what else is new?!"

Each month of pregnancy is covered in detail and gives the reader knowledge of what to expect when the time comes. This is so valuable, helping to alleviate fears that tend to crop up from time to time. The book covers breast feeding and circumcision, although those topics weren't covered in as much detail as I would have liked. I realize I will need to purchase a breast-feeding book for more details and also join the group my doctor has recommended to prepare for the hurdles I may encounter. Even my husband has read several of the topics of interest to him and commented on how precise everything is written in this book.

Don&#8217;t look at another word. Did you hear me? Not. One. More. Word.I wish I&#8217;d listened. Not that I advocate burning books but I do savor my free time and I really wasted it here.I had high hopes for this when it began. It&#8217;s read by none other than Doug Bradley of Pinhead fame and he has such a lovely accent and manner of speaking that I figured I&#8217;d fall in love with this story. It didn't happen. I haven&#8217;t read a recent Clive Barker novel in ages but I have recently reread his Books of Blood (both 1 and 2) as well The Hellbound Heart and was expecting, I suppose, something remotely similar. But again, it didn't happen. There were no lush descriptions, no interesting story-line or characters, no wild imaginative fantasy worlds. Really there was nothing at all that made me want to keep going.But I did anyway.So here&#8217;s the gist. Jakabok Botch is a demon born and raised in the 9th ring of hell (which is hardly described, I might add). Jakabok starts off things by sharing his tale of childhood woe. His parents, both lower level demons, weren't very nice to him and as a child he fell face first into flames and burned himself to an ugly crisp before dad bothered to pull him out. Later, through a strange series of events, he finds himself removed from hell and making his way among humans. He then shares his recollections of life among them in first person but surprisingly, though he does some nasty things and meets some nasty beings, it&#8217;s all rather uneventful and ho-hum in the telling. I didn't find it clever, or darkly funny or even disgustingly gory. It was just &#8220;meh&#8221; and I never felt a part of the action. In between his recollections he threatens to skin me and crap because I'm so brazen as to keep reading. This silliness got very tiresome, very quickly and really fell flat in audio format.It is with much sadness that I can only give Mister B Gone a 3 (and that&#8217;s being a wee bit generous). I had to force myself to listen and had to rewind several times because I kept drifting away and could not stay focused. Doug Bradley does a great job with the narration but even he and his musical accent couldn&#8217;t save this lackluster story for me."

doc05728,book,train,"MCAUSLAN IN THE ROUGH is George MacDonald Fraser's 1974 sequel to THE GENERAL DANCED AT DAWN. In the former, Dand MacNeill continues to reminisce about his time spent as a subaltern commanding a platoon of tartan-kilted Scottish Highlanders during the period 1945-1947 while the battalion is posted to both Libya and Edinburgh. One of MacNeill's Jocks is Pvt. John McAuslan, by consensus the filthiest, most unkempt soldier in the British Army. As Dand records:""... (his) grey-white shirt was open to the waist, revealing what was either his skin or an old vest, you couldn't tell which. His hair was tangled and his mouth hung open; altogether he looked as though he'd just completed a bell-ringing stint at Notre Dame.""Each of Fraser's books is a collection of short stories relating to events experienced by Dand and his battalion, and particularly his platoon, and which are based on Fraser's own service in the Gordon Highlanders during the same time period. So, in this volume, the lieutenant and his comrades-in-arms garrison an isolated desert outpost for a month, face the controversial inclusion of a black piper in the regimental band (it is, after all, 1946), compete in a general knowledge quiz contest with the Fusiliers regiment, contemplate McAuslan's dubious success with the ladies, mount a nighttime raid on the local Souk to apprehend two deserters, and engage the Royals regiment in a golf tournament. And, lastly, what happens when Dand and McAuslan are released from active duty (""demobbed"") on the same day. Whereas in GENERAL McAuslan's contribution to events was erratic and usually of brief duration, in ROUGH his role is expanded to the point where he's a key player in four of the seven chapters.  As always, MacNeill's first person narration, both witty and good-natured, ties it all together.Note: MCAUSLAN IN THE ROUGH is currently out of print in the US. However, it and Fraser's two other books in the McAuslan series, THE GENERAL DANCED AT DAWN and THE SHEIKH AND THE DUSTBIN, are all contained in THE COMPLETE MCAUSLAN. I found this to be a captivating and entertaining volume, which I heartily recommend to anyone who is a student of the British military's former role in establishing and policing the Empire. One notable characteristic of Fraser's writing is his ability to quote Dand's Jocks, and put their heavily accented Scottish dialect on paper. By the end of the book, I could actually understand what was being ""said""."

They were once little girls, awkward teenagers, young and old women.

The technology exists for this urban fantasy to come true. Do I think it will? Probably not. But it could and that's what makes The Unidentified so exciting and easy to read and scary. The students' inTouches are a seamless combination and integration of Facebook and Twitter and shows how those technologies can be usurped and used for more nefarious purposes.If you've readNineteen Eighty-Fourby George Orwell you'll appreciate the sentiment of Mariz's novel. Her Big Brother is just as scary and controlling altho' her Big Brother uses less threatening means to control the masses. While her Big Brother may be less threatening Mariz's is a great deal more sinister as it is only teenagers who are controlled by the Game, and what will become of these children who grow up and are educated, if one can call what they experience within the Game an education, in an environment inundated with advertisements and sponsors and a level of peer pressure nearly unheard of in our society? While I don't think The Unidentified was written with the idea of a sequel in mind I would very much like to see how Kid and her friends turn out as adults. Mariz's characters are lively and endearing and are characters I want to know more about.I highly recommend this book for young adults and adults alike and it's a must read for fans of dystopias, George Orwell, and anyone who is curious about how our modern technology can be used in more sinister ways."

doc01999,book,train,"HEAT AND DUST is Jhabvala's most famous novel, but it's never really made it into the bigtime of novels concerning Anglo-Indian relations. Although sensitively and intelligently written, the novel's biggest problem is that the two major female characters aren't fully fleshed out: there seems to be much less to interest us regarding the narrator (who is almost a total cypher) and Olivia than there is regarding the Nawab and Chid. Still, the evocations of India both in the Seventies and the Twenties are quite marvelous. All in all, I'd say this is a well-written novel, but not quite up to the level of such other works which take on a similar theme as Paul Scott's THE JEWEL IN THE CROWN or Rumer Godden's THE PEACOCK SPRING."
doc02750,book,valid,"I am an Urban Fantasy gal all the way.  Every so often I enjoy a little paranormal romance. While I like some romantic tension in my books, I don't necessarily need or enjoy a book that is 25% or more bedroom scenes.  Yet there are a few paranormal romances that I fully embrace (Kresley Cole, J.R. Ward, Kerrlyn Sparks).  I was not expecting to more than casually enjoy this new book by Terri Garey, ""Devil Without A Cause"".  I liked her Nicki Styx books well enough, in part because I am a sucker for a ghost story.  Those books featured the Devil, Sammy Devine in a recurring role.  I couldn't stand Sammy in those books.  He was cocky and just plain didn't do anything for me.  While I was happy to hear the author sold a new series, I wasn't sure I would be interested...an entire series featuring Sammy and no ghosts?  Yet I ordered the book last week and started reading it today.  And I finished it today.Needless to say, the book was fantastic. I obsessively read page after page stopping for a couple of bathroom breaks and lunch. The writing was wonderful and the story engaging.  Sammy was still the same character from the Nicki Styx series and yet seeing his world from his eyes made him a much more enjoyable character.  His sarcasm here was spot on and his personality was a fantastic blend of evil incarnate, and sympathetic fallen angel. His home in Hell was unique and unlike any other Hell I have seen imagined in a novel.  Mixing mythology, folklore, and Bilbical elements, many of the names and backstories seem familiar, yet twisted around and made into something unique and entirely the author's creation.The story is about Sammy's devil's bargain with two people who find their lives suddenly entwined in a battle that could determine if they lose their souls to Sammy.  For Faith, her eternal soul's damnation is the least of her worries.  She is far more concerned about the life of her four year old son Nathan who has brain cancer.  Sammy's bargain involves whether the poor child will live or die.  Rock star Finn Payne made a pact with Sammy years ago, selling his soul for fortune and fame.  Faith and Finn were both likeable characters from the start and I fell in love with young Nathan.  The story never failed to make suprising twists and turns...this is not your standard romance story.I am going to talk this book up to everyone that will have a lesson because I truly found reading it to be a wonderful way to spend most of my lazy Sunday. I wholeheartedly look forward to visiting Sammy's Hell again, the sooner the better.  This book has definitely eased the pain of finding out the Nicki Styx series was concluded."

doc02888,book,train,"The first time I visited Beijing's Dashanzi art district several years ago, I wandered into a crowded gallery only to find a guy lying in the middle of the floor, wrapped in a flag, while some people were dripping candle wax onto him and others were shooting video. A few steps outside and I was introduced to another artist whose specialty was painting himself to blend into various walls. Nell Freudenberger's first novel evokes well the performance art milieu of Beijing, at least from the perspective of an outsider looking in. From having lived ten years or so in West Los Angeles, I'd also say she manages a good satire of life there (though that's a much easier target).While some reviewers prefer either the Chinese  narrative or the L.A. one, I thought they complemented each other well. Even if the American characters aren't always as engaging as the title character, the author has a great ear and warm imagination for their dialogue. E.g., a spoiled private high school student who's spent time in France, impressed that her classmate's brother went to a party at his Latina girlfriend's home in the Echo Park neighborhood: ""'Wow,' said Emily, 'a c'est vraiment le barrio.'"" And the characters who need to be likable, are.The story sometimes has a typical first-novelish, self-reflective preoccupation with the theme of 'what is art?,' but it manages to be interesting on that topic. NF's treatments of identity and ""dissidence"" are also nicely structured, with many interesting parallels and contrasts among the characters; better yet, she doesn't hit you over the head with these by having her characters call attention to them.  This is a very satisfying novel -- I'm definitely looking forward to reading the next one from this author."
doc08186,book,valid,"Here is an interesting book about a relatively little-known historical figure, Christina Queen of Sweden in the 17th century.Christina was the daughter of a great Swedish King, Gustav Adolph the Great. She was intellectually gifted, spoke languages, conversed with great men of her day, and early on gained a reputation across Europe as a kind of enlightened ruler.Her invitations to visit the Swedish Court were gladly accepted by Europe's famous figures, but the results often proved not so happy as might have been expected. One of the century's greatest intellects, Rene Descartes, made the trip, reluctantly at first but giving in finally to her blandishments, and died at her court. She kept the rooms cold and expected the great man to meet with her at dawn to discuss philosophy.That event certainly was an early indicator of her rather bizarre personality. And so too, her behaviour after Descartes' death: she was full of superficial grief and vowed to build an impressive monument, but it was all forgotten shortly, a pattern of behaviour she repeated many times.Christina proved an inept ruler, indeed she abdicated because she had no interest in the genuine work of ruling. She proved a person of less than shining ethics, a generally confused person, likely suffering from mental illness.Christiana decided to become a Catholic, and her abdication of the throne of stoutly Protestant Sweden is closely associated with that fact. After carefully arranging matters like the succession and the revenues she would receive for the rest of her life, Christina travelled to Rome to meet and be welcomed by the Pope, who, naturally in view of the times - the Thirty Years' War from 1618 to 1648 - viewed her conversion as a victory for Catholicism.The Pope and every other great person she met contributed to her extravagant and expensive lifestyle - Christina was never ashamed to take large handouts from the great and powerful, and indeed she actively solicited them.Almost everyone who had close dealings with her came to regret it. Her appearance at times was outlandish and bizarre, her behaviour was quite offensive at times, and there seemed no consistency to her except the need to be deemed royal, treated as royals should be treated, and to do in most things pretty much as she pleased.Her exploits included having a servant who displeased her killed on the spot, quite a scandalous episode in its day. After all her talk about Catholicism and taking the Pope's hospitality, at times Christina talked as though she were no longer interested in being Catholic. After abdicating the throne of Sweden, she played many intrigues in Rome and in France to try landing herself another crown. When she thought she was being cheated by Sweden on her lifetime payments, she travelled all the way back in an effort to get what she felt entitled to.Christina's example perhaps best tells us how good it is that we are beyond the times of powerful rule by inheritance. The good of her people played virtually no role in her thinking, and her conviction that royal blood meant a lifetime of privileged treatment even when you weren't assuming any of the responsibilities associated with the privileges is one that is utterly alien to us.The writer does a sound and competent job on an interesting subject, but the writing is not elegant, and one definitely gets the feeling that the author avoids saying things directly, things which should be said. For example, Christina's sexual life is left rather ambiguous. There are clear signs that she was homosexual, including a pronounced mannish appearance, but I think the author needed to examine this more carefully if she was going to deal with it at all.So too her relationship with Cardinal Decio Azzolino, called the great love of her life, is left to me unsatisfactorily explained. One definitely questions whether Christina was capable of loving anyone."

I really like most of her other books, but I am struggling to even finish this one.  Let's hope the rest of the series are similar to the first book."
doc00208,book,valid,"The story was ok, but when all was said and don't, I felt like it was a waste of time.  I could have re-read something else and enjoyed myself more.  The quote on the cover about what a great writer the author is... well, clearly that reviewer and I have a difference of opinion.I read this genre because the world building is so much fun to read and explore.  Here, there really wasn't much of that.  And the characters are very flat and there isn't much development of them either.The story is goes like this:  Sir Michael is a knight errant and Fisk is his squire.  Michael rescued Fisk since Fisk is really a con man.  They set out to rescue Lady Ceciel and it turns out that they help a criminal escape.  So, their ""adventure"" becomes the quest to meet the conditions of Michael father's ""probation"" after he rescues Fisk and Michael from their troubles when it is discovered that they helped the lady escape.  They now have to recapture the Lady and bring her to the lord so that justice can be carried out.The most exciting part of the plot was the escape from having been ""cudgel-crewed"".  And the most interesting character is Lady Kara but we see so very little of her that we don't get a chance to know her.  Fisk - we know he has a past, but we learn nothing at all and as a result it's hard to stay interested.  We learn a little more about Michael because we see his father but it's still very one dimensional.The world that is built doesn't really get described very well.  We learn that there is a furred god and that there are 2 moons, and this stuff called magica.  And while its a safe (and correct) inference that magica is magic, for some reason it's bad for people to do.  And animals and plants and stuff can be magica but to kill either one must make a sacrifice or something will come back to harm you.  It's kinda like instant karma.  But, we get no additional information.  Zero.  It's like the author was really only sort of interested in writing a book about magic.  Until we get towards the end.  And then Lady Ceciel seems to have some ideas about magica but we get, what felt like, the same chapter 3 times in a row.  And we still really don't learn much that adds to the story.  In fact, I was slightly disturbed by the ""simple ones"" and the way the author dealt with them as a class of people.  And it made me hard to understand how experimenting on them should be something in a YA book.The alternating chapter narratives are a little difficult too.  I don't mind alternating view points most times.  But for some reason, it was often hard to track/remember.  I found that many times, I had to look back to the first page of the chapter to see who's name was on it to know who's point of view I was reading.I know this is the first in a series but I don't plan on bothering with the next.  There just isn't enough of the characters to keep me interested.  And the made up terms that aren't explained and the one-dimensional universe... too little to keep me interested at all."

doc01035,book,train,"'Under a Silent Moon' is the first police/procedural novel I have read by Elizabeth Haynes. As a former Intelligence Analyst, she brings a great deal of inside information into this series. Included in this novel are daily briefings in the morning and evening, case documents, charts and files of the on-going case, and a copy if the IBM's Analyst Notebook Software. There is also a name for the investigation, which occurs in every case. This one is called, 'Op Nettle'. As the author states, this book is intended to simulate an authentic murder investigation . I found this fascinating and added to the case.Dispatch Logs opens this case, and along with the briefings and analysis, we are given emails between the characters, texts of phone messages, and the thoughts of the characters involved, police and the public. This is the first murder case for DCI Louisa Smith, and she wants to make it her own, she wants it solved, she wants specific communication and interaction between the participants. During the course of the case, we discover, she is excellent at her job. A young woman has been found murdered, her face beaten to a pulp. She lives in a wealthy community, inhabited by those who go to lunch, some have jobs but they all have some money, some more, some less. Most are upstanding individuals, but there are those with the criminal element, and they all are not just the public.The interaction between DCI Smith and her team is crucial to this book. This is how a murder case is looked at and solved. The everyday updates,the plodding, tiring work. The office romances, the after work drinking at the pub, the relationships developed and reduced. All the while, the main focus is to find the culprit responsible for the murders, since another one has been discovered.  The case moves along rapidly, and we are with the officers every step of the way. We get to know them, and we get to know the other characters. This is fine writing, very involved and intricate at times. I enjoyed this style of police/procedural, and will follow DCI Smith, as her caseload increases.Recommended. prisrob 02-05-14"

doc00455,book,train,"I almost passed this book up and decided I would give it a go. I am so glad I did. This book was pretty amazing. I was captivated by the story from the very beginning and stayed that way throughout the entire book. The characters were pretty super, the pacing was well done, the writing was exciting, and I just enjoyed this book immensely.Jax celebrates his 13th birthday, goes to bed, wakes up in an abandoned world. He believes the apocalypse has come, but what has really happened is he is part of special group of people that can live in the eighth day. A day that exists between Wednesday and Thursday. There are others that experience this day and who live only within this day. Jax discovers all the secrets that surrounds this day and also the dangers. He unknowingly brings horrible danger to a friends front door, now its up to him and other Transitioners to save the eighth day and the world.This book was really really good. I didn't really know what I was in for, I thought the book sounded more sci-fi, time traveling, parallel universe. Nope its fantasy, magic, myths.... and I loved it. One of my favorite aspects of this book, the myth that surrounded the Eighth Day. Merlin, Arthur, and even the Knights of the Round Table had a bit to do with the Eighth Day. I have read many Merlin or Arthur retellings, inspirations, and renditions. This one was quite original. I was fascinated by the idea. It was well thought out and well done. The story was definitely the main focus for me.The characters were good too. It did take me a bit longer to connect to them than I like, but once I did the connection was strong. There was tons of story building, so the character building lacked just a tiny bit at first. In the end I fell for everyone of the characters. There is quite a variety of them too. The main character Jax, was my favorite. He was kind, brave, generous, and very true to doing what he felt was right. He was a normal 13 year old and generally acted first and planned after. He made some bad decisions but he was determined to make up for those choices.Evangeline was a bit harder to connect with. I liked what I knew. She was sweet. She was a loyal friend, and she had a bit of attitude. Riley was hard to like at first, a jerk at first site, but I loved him once I got to know him. He was very loyal and very protective over those he loved. He didn't think twice about doing what needed to be done and never failed to jump in when needed. I hope to see so much more of him in the next book. There was quite a bit more characters, but they weren't as major. They were all fun and fit well into the story, adding laughter and trouble.The story read well, started out running and ended with a bang. There was lots of action, thrills, humor, adventure, and discovery. The ending left me wanting more but also had some resolution. I closed the book with a smile on my face and hole that needs to be filled with next book.Awesome read. I would highly recommend this book for those that love MG books or wanting to dabble to see what its like. Also great for any kind of fantasy lovers or fans of Arthurian mythology."

doc06204,book,train,"On one hand, I liked that this was a romance novel written from the point of view of a young woman. And to that end, it felt true. On the other hand, the narrator failed to see times when her boyfriend was damn near abusive toward her: following her around, interfering (sometimes violently) in her life especially when she was near other men (granted they were often physically threatening, but it still felt off that she was so appreciative of his violence). I think his aggression was supposed to read as virile and protective, but to this reader, it felt like a bad precedent being set. College age girls should feel free to act as they please and not have their lives &#34;protected&#34; by an aggressive (even if well meaning) man."

The people in these books obsessively play MMORPG's. They're sick.

I have no interest in it, even though I should. To me, it's magic. And not the good kind of magic that Merlin uses. It's the &#34;any sufficiently advanced something is indistinguishable from magic&#34; that Arthur C. Clarke uses.

doc05795,book,train,"I really debated with myself on whether to write this review. Religious matters are very delicate and debates over religion can anger many people. This review therefore applies only to me: my thoughts, beliefs and questions as it relates to this book.Several years before reading the Da Vinci Code I was very interested in reading about the alternative Bibles as they were called. There were a lot of practices in the Catholic religion that I just did not see as logical. For example, the Pope had the power to issue certificates guaranteeing Heaven if followers gave money to the Church (a mere mortal can guarantee Heaven?); priests could forgive ones of their sins (isn't God alone Who can do that?); the trinity (found it confusing and illogical; how can Christ be God and the son of God?); the fact that priests and nuns are not aloud to marry (yet you hear stories of homosexuality and child abuse); there are many Bibles written by different authors (so which one is the most accurate, or put in other words, which one alone do all scholars agree on?); the corruption of popes throughout history (history portrayed many popes as self serving); and the list goes on.Is it possible that the true Bible lies hidden and undiscovered? That question is what encouraged me to read books relating to religious matters, including gnostic and apocryphal books. During my student years my friends used to think I was weird for reading such books. But I have to admit they were thrilling, and the questions and answers kept increasing. And I kept reading on.Upon reading the Dead Sea Scrolls, I became enamored by these new texts. Another possibility was offered, and one that made more sense. Readers who later read the Da Vinci Code also came to the conclusion that Dan Brown's version of the stories of the Bible made more sense. But does something that makes more sense necessarily the truth? Answers give rise to new questions, and this quest in finding the true words of God seem unending, yet a fascinating journey, and one that I am gladly taking.My interest in the Gnostic Gospels is both scholarly and religious. Scholarly because deep down I believe that there must be one formula joining all the religions of the world together (and you do find many similarities in many of the World religions). Scholarly because old biblical texts (or any religious books) are a fascinating read.Why were some religious books labeled as Gnostic or apocryphal, while others were regarded as the true words of God? Did self interest play a part (if you ask me, I'd say of course)? Were religious texts rejected because they were not to a King's interest in ruling his kingdom? Were passages changed to suit the politics of the day? Why was such care taken in hiding certain religious texts?As mentioned earlier, you'll come up with more questions than answers after reading the Gnostic Gospels.I enjoyed how the author briefly quotes passages from each gnostic Gospel, and his explanation of each text. This is a good introduction to the Gnostic Gospels, but not the end of the road."

doc02772,book,valid,"Reading the works of Nicholas A. Basbanes is somewhat like attending a series of lectures by a master professor, one who loves his subject passionately and seems to know every aspect of it. In this volume, as in the preceding works of his trilogy, Mr. Basbanes takes you around the world and back in forth in time, yet the journey always has a constant purpose: to explore the many ways in which humankind has transmitted its thoughts in written form.A central theme of this work is the many assaults on the written word through the ages, and their ultimate triumph of survival. From the destruction of Carthage to the Nazi book-burnings and the more recent destruction of libraries in Tibet, Cambodia, Sarajevo, the written word has again and again been one of the prime targets for those who wish to subjugate a people. Yet for all that has been lost through violence and neglect, much has been preserved.Here Basbanes turns to threats to books of a different sort--libraries discarding little-used volumes because of space issues, or various electronic technologies that have been heralded as being the replacement for the codex, or bound book, as we have known it for centuries. Yet the book endures,  and if enough people with the passion of Nicholas A. Basbanes are around, it should endure for countless years to come.This book and its two predecessors represents an educational, entertaining and thought-provoking distillation of a career spent learning about and celebrating the written word. Although ""A Splendor of Letters"" marks the completion of his trilogy, I hope this will not be the last word Mr. Basbanes has to share on the subject. And I'm sure many other readers feel the same way.--William C. Hall"
doc07735,book,train,"Diaspora reads more like a series of interconnected short stories than a solid novel like Egan's Permutation City or Quarantine. Much like Charles Stross's Accelerando (which was admittedly published in 2005 compared to Egan's earlier 1998), there is an acceleration in technology towards the mythical technological singularity, each short story driving the science further and further.As mentioned above, my experience with Egan's novels are drawn at Permutation City and Quarantine. Each of these novels was rich in science and had my head spinning like a cyclotron of wonder. The science was deep but it wasn't over my head like I needed to skip entire paragraphs to get past the meat. However, in Diaspora it's exactly the opposite. There's like room was awe to blossom as the meat of the science was so dense I found myself just skimming paragraphs and sometimes entire pages.Don't get me wrong, the direction Egan takes is impressive, it's big; the ideas go unchallenged as far as I'm concerned in the realm of science fiction. The characters refiguring the long established physics upon witnessing an impossible event is so deeply engrained in the cast's psyche that it's even possible the Egan, himself, dares to challenge modern theories on theoretical physics. It's big... but it's not an easy read nor is it, at times, a particularly enjoyable journey.I don't read Egan for his straightforward writing style, but he surprised me a few times with some clever, insightful prose to contrast his rambling science bits. Best example was on page 208 in the first paragraph of a new story: `...the occasion seemed to demand the complete ritual of verisimilitude, the ornate curlicued longhand of imitation physical cause and effect.' Actually, that entire chapter is composed of a mere two paragraphs but easily stands out from the rest of the book as if touched by Midas himself. I've never seen any author describe the sky as isotropic.As much as I would like to give a synopsis of each short story, the amount of work it would entail would be equally as arduous as some of the passages about six-dimensional physics and spatial awareness. Each of the nine stories was a solid 4-of-5 star rating while the final story sort of lost steam and fell behind with 3 stars."
doc07152,book,valid,"This book was well designed.  The introduction by Phil Counsineau alone is worth the price.  Instead of hidden away in some appendix, the Chronology of Joseph Campbell is up front before reading the details.  The book is written mostly in a question and answer format.Next striking thing is the pictures that accompany the text makes you feel that some one knew that Joseph was going to be some one of interest and sent a professional photographer to follow his life.  He has pictures with and/or (Buffalo Bill Cody, Black Elk, James Joyce, Jiddu Krishnamurti, Thomas Mann, Karlfried Graf D&uuml;rkheim, Carl Jung, Linda Ronstadt...) of all kinds of people that you would think came from different eras, most impressive is his portrait University of Paris.One thing you will notice of Joseph Campbell is that he has a way of looking at life that most people do not until it pointed out.  Some times he will seem to be just telling you the most mundane information and all of a sudden ties it to a point that was overlooked.Reading this book on his life will give you a better insight as to his works."
doc05622,book,valid,"One of my favorite scenes in this series took place in this book.  It was between Paavo and a 9 year old girl, after the murder of her grandfather, in a tenement building.  The chapter containing that segment confirmed for me that Pence is not only an artist and an author, she's a master of her craft.On the subject of fav's, I'll quote two passages which ID, or expose the essence of Angie and Paavo better than any other I've found in the series.Quoting Angie's comment to Paavo, on page 231 of the mass market paperback:>> ""I want so much to do interesting things ... I want to be accomplished, an achiever.  I want to be a person who is independent and successful, and good at her job - not daddy's privileged little rich girl.  Not that that's so tragic.  But I'm more than that, aren't I?"" &lt;&lt;Angie is a special character in many subtle and easy-to-see ways.  I was annoyed by a reader's criticism that Angie is annoying.  My first reaction to that comment was, ""How wrong and how rude!""  More than enough opinions weigh in favor of Angie being a capturing character in every nuance.  In this novel, both she and Paavo continued to grow in warm, cozy, and realistic ways.Paavo's personal pondering:>> Home.  He wished he didn't get a kick in the gut each time he thought about the cottage.  He liked being there more than he ever dreamed he would, and more than he really wanted to admit.  He had found a place away from the world's cruelty and losses where there was love and laughter, and he wondered how long he could accept it, or if he would soon want to retreat to his own quiet solitude once more. &lt;&lt;Yep.  That's Paavo.I might add a note here that, for me, retreating into quiet solitude is as much, possibly more, a part of what I need in a home as love and laughter.  With intuitive wisdom, Angie gives Paavo all of this, a safe, comforting place to rest or hide when a cocoon is needed for a time, and a safe place to play.  The first she gives in sensitivity but not easily; the second she gives with easy, natural relish.TO CATCH A COOK.  To catch, to capture, to get, to comprehend.  Is catching something like ""getting it"" or like identifying it?  Yep.  Yes.  You bettcha.Yeah, this was one of my favorite books in the Angie series, mainly because the mystery of Paavo's childhood was so intriguingly and realistically dealt with.Pence has an ability to create emotional catharsis within intrigue. Her series exudes warmth and wit, as noted in my Listmania title, before I changed it to, ""Joanne Pence Mystery Series; Better Than Nora Roberts.""Pence has something beyond those qualities, though.  Charm?  Yeah.  Complexity?  Yeah.  Vision?  Yes.  But, what word am I hunting for here ...Is it somehow the true essence of Mystery that Pence is so good at capturing?  I can say that no mater how convoluted your brain, you could never imagine the history Paavo has been given in this book.  And, yet it fits every other piece in the puzzle of this series, in not only the books which came before TO CATCH A COOK, but also in the ones to follow.How does she do this?  How does Pence evolve a mystery which deftly and faithfully carries threads and symbolism  throughout a series, without even being conscious of all the machinations herself?She's an artist.  She's an author.Maybe it's as simple and as convoluted as that.Twists?  Pence has a corner on that market.  She tied this plot into so many interesting knots I'm surprised she was able to get out of the Gordian herself.  Of course she did it.  It almost felt as if she danced her way through a family labyrinth, then hopped onto the kitchen table to finish the footwork.I began to see in this book, in sequence to others read prior to it, how amazingly Joanne is able to slightly change the style and mood of each story, yet retain the essence and evolution (the identifying factor?) of wherever this collection is headed.Never say life isn't symbolic.  Never say fiction doesn't reflect life.  As Joanne says, ""Life Happens.""  And so it does.As she sows, so shall she write.  And we reap the entertainment.Thankfully, I have a few more Angie mysteries to read in past offerings in this magical series.  If I'm finished with what came before, what will I ever do after I finish reading the latest Angie novel (tentatively set to be published December, 2006)?Stay tuned.  There's more to life than meets the eye.  Once in a blue moon, trite gets the last word right.Yeah, but here's the REAL conundrum:How do you identify something precisely and accurately when it has an intense evolutionary factor, through which its identity is doing the metamorphosis thing?  Will Joanne's series end up with butterflies or dragonflies on the covers?  And what do they eat?Here's why, to me, Angie is a life-blood refreshing character:As a prior teacher of English Lit, I've tried to understand the reverence of Literary Novels, ""Classical Literature.""  Could rarely get into most of the stuff because it was too depressing. I was seldom (if ever) in the mood to voluntarily depress or deflate myself.  But sometimes I tried to read those hefty tomes, like HEART OF DARKNESS by Joseph Conrad, Graham Green's novels, F. Scott Fitzgerald's GREAT GATSBY. I read enough to see and appreciate the masterful use of the language; I drooled over the exquisite beauty of the syntax, plots, and character complexity.  But I began to feel disgusted, angry, and betrayed at these truly great authors who seemed to believe they had to write (probably in an alcoholic or drugged haze) with such graceful severity about the bowels of the Earth, always ending with a spirit leaching, evil panache.  I felt like jumping off a cliff to get away from the doom of the no win life they portrayed.It appeared to me that to write great literature was to be ugly serious and to travel through beautifully executed  words, but to use them only within the down sides of life. The words themselves must have felt trapped in hell.  Or executed.After I've exposed that opinion, would anyone wonder why I like Angie?There are ways to write about the deeper, darker sides of life without steeping the reader's psyche into the sourest soups of reality, and committing him there for eternity. Is our cultural heritage sick or what, to believe so strongly in that type of literary curse?  The term, ""crying in your soup"" is trite, but it fits too many of the ""classics"" too well.But, okay.  Certainly there's a place for depressing literature, for dredging the swamps of life.  I really don't want to condemn southern exposures (actually I loved that Alaska TV series), even though I'm not drawn to it (as a rule), and have rarely forced myself to read every page of those types of novels.  In college, Cliff Notes literally saved my life a few times.What I'd like to see in addition to these types of Pulitzer Prize offerings, is more Great Literature with the type of mood catharsis Joanne Pence accomplished in the urine touched tenement scene in TO CATCH A COOK, when the well set stench transformed with a single sentence describing the clean aura of the apartment in which a 9-year-old girl sat.  Pence gave that apartment a feel of purity, a distance from tenement soullessness, even with the girl's grandfather lying dead in the next room. Yet, Pence had spared no odor in the detailed painting of the ugliness of life in that world.  She painted it as it should be exposed.Then, in that single sentence, with a few carefully chosen words about the lack of leftover food cartons, she lifted the hopeless despair into something still truly sad, but somehow refreshingly healing and quietly cathartic, even as the girl was dealing with that gut wrenching situation.The author moved the plot further into this emotional purity within the simple exchange between Paavo and the girl.  He knew how she felt; he had lived it.  He also knew how to be with her, what to give her, yet to avoid breaking her difficultly maintained composure, to avoid dishonoring who she was and how she had come to deal with her life with a loved but un-pampered child's simple and serious dignity.That scene was so powerful, I was heavily reluctant to leave it.  As the story moved forward, I found myself wondering about the little girl, but the continued shifting of plot was more than enough to keep me busy and fueled.  The girl's return in a few potent vignettes artistically and satisfyingly concluded her part in the story, as one of the symbolic links to Paavo's past.This is a gem-in-the-crown of a series fit for royalty among readers.Bless the best among us as we each evolve toward unique exposures of personal perfection,Linda G. Shelnutt"
doc00620,book,valid,"I recently borrowed ""When Prophecy Fails"" from my psychology proffesor. I have been interested in the theory of cognitive dissonance since I first came across it in my general psychology text book, and was thrilled at the opportunity to read the source of it all.The book is an easy read; at times it feels more like a novel than a psychological study. After the initial first few chapters of background information, it falls into an easy description of Marian Keech and her fellow Seekers. Festinger and his co-authors do a fine job of illustrating Mrs. Keech's ideology and the history of her doomsday prophecies. The description of the group members on the days leading up to and after the predicted cataclysm is very detailed.However, this high amount of detail is also what makes me hesitant about truly endorsing this book as an ethical psychological study. Festinger & co. gave ample enough hints at the location and press coverage of the group that confidentiality cannot have been preserved. Just a few minutes with google provided me with the real identities of the cult members described in the book. Though I think the study may have been conducted before the APA created the ethical guidelines, I still found myself somewhat horrified by the looseness of the confidentiality. While ""When Prophecy Fails"" is an interesting read, it does very little to scientifically prove its hypothesis in a way that could not have been done in a less damaging way. Though my searches seemed to indicate that Mrs. Keech and her fellow believers moved on, I still feel a great deal of pity for the woman and her comrades. Even though their beliefs were absurd, did they really deserve to be so cruelly tricked? I am not sure about this. And so I am not sure that the means justifies the end in this particular landmark study.Nevertheless, the book is certainly a must-read for anyone who is interested in landmark studies and the history of psychology."
doc02131,book,train,"To put these comments in perspective, &quot;Jesus, A New Vision&quot; (published originally in 1987), is the third book by Dr. Borg that I have read; thus, I'm clearly a fan.The first Borg book I read was &quot;Meeting Jesus Again for the First Time,&quot; originally published in 1994 -- a book that covers almost the identical terrain as &quot;Jesus, A New Vision.&quot;It's important to realize, if you haven't read Borg before, that his books are based on mainstream biblical scholarship that is taught in seminaries of mainstream churches.  He is not a radical, far-out religious liberal trying to undermine contemporary and/or traditional Christian theology.To provide some idea of Borg's scholarship.  This book's  &quot;Introduction - Clearing the Ground: Two Images of Jesus&quot; extends a little over sixteen pages, the &quot;Introduction's&quot; Annotated End Notes (Footnotes) covers five pages, and should be carefully studied by those who may be particularly upset by some of the author's ideas.The book is divided into two parts.  Part One, Chapters 2-4, discuss Jesus and the Spirit, or Jesus and God.  Part Two, Chapters 5-10, discussing Jesus and Culture; with the focus on the culture of the first century.  Chapter 10, the author's conclusion is entitled, &quot;The New Vision of Jesus: His Significance for Our Time.&quot;  Borg's observations and conclusions are thoroughly documented.  It seems difficult to imagine anyone quarreling with his conclusions.I'm somewhat shocked that until learning about Borg in a newspaper article (last fall) announcing a local speaking engagement by Dr. Borg, which I attended, I had never heard of him.  Again please note; this book was published in 1987, fourteen years ago.  His writings and views have not been featured in either the mainstream press I've been reading and/or by clergy in the Protestant churches I've attended.Also, I'm equally mystified as to why the electronic media have not done features on Borg and his views.  With so much &quot;air-time&quot; to fill, why haven't they covered Borg?  Fear?  Fear of what?This and other Borg titles are extremely easy to read, even for readers with a minimum of background in either the Hebrew Old Testament, or the Christian New Testament.Borg's views are the most plausible, rationale approach to the historical Jesus of fact, faith and experience I've ever encountered.  I consider this book to be a blessing and I urge every thinking Christian to read it and other writings by Dr. Borg."

Both of those things detracted from the story. That being said, Bea was my favorite character in this book.

To do that, the services of an international trapeze artist are required.

Alistair Maclean's best books are much more compact, the level of tension is much higher, the images more detailed and reliable, and the whole experience is unlike anything other authors are capable of copying.

doc07197,book,train,"Catherine Fullbright has learned how nasty men can be having spent time locked in a closet by her abusive father when she was a preadolescent; she also observed males behaving like hedonistic pigs as she saw first hand how her scandalous father treated women.  Thus as a child she and her three female cousins vowed to never marry.By 1811, Catherine's father needs his two daughters married off, but feels the eldest must wed first.  Catie refuses though her younger sister Elizabeth is as always compliant, obedient, and nasty but also engaged to Lord Valentine.  Dad gives Catie until tonight's ball to choose a mate or he will find her one.  She and her cousins plot to stop Lizzie's nuptials, but her father trumps her.  Catie marries Lord Valentine, Quint Childers; angering her sibling and making her new husband wonder when this wildcat hellion will destroy his political career as he planned on the compliant one as his wife.  Still he enjoys her spirit, her caring about the welfare of others and that she seems to genuinely love him like he does her.  However, he must persuade her to trust him as not all men demand strict obedience supported by punishment.This is an interesting Regency romance starring a young woman who learns as a child the excesses of dominating males and takes that lesson to adulthood as she has vowed to remain a spinster.  Quint is a patient protagonist who reassesses his ambitions once he finds the wrong wife in his bed; he gives Catie time to adapt, but fears she will never overcome the abuse.

doc04371,book,train,"Escaping to novelist Patricia Wentworth's world is fraught with danger. You'll probably find yourself at a week-end house party. At these parties, it is always the case that by Sunday morning someone is found murdered.In this novel, the ivory dagger of the title is thought to be the murder weapon. Host Herbert Whittall had shown this prized possession to his guests the previous night. Now, the bloody dagger is in the blood stained hands of the girl found beside the murdered host, the girl who had been unwillingly betrothed to him. This is the blood-soaked tableau that postpones Sunday morning's breakfast.A precedent for this situation is found in the Donizetti opera ""Lucia di Lammermoor"" and Sir Walter Scott's novel ""The Bride of Lammermoor"" upon which it is based. Patricia Wentworth weaves illusions to these works into her own novel. For example, the guests pass their Saturday evening listening to gramophone records of excerpts from the Donizetti opera.Mostly through dialogue, Patricia Wentworth provides the murder investigation. Motives and opportunities for murder abound. There is an incredibly long chain of witnesses who were themselves witnessed. Almost everybody does a bit or eavesdropping indoors and prowling around the garden outdoors in the wee small hours. Even Miss Silver has a stint of this, listening and seeing in at a partially open French window.If all of this keeps you well-entertained until a confession is offered in Chapter 39, don't fail to read on until the last page. Patricia Wentworth has also contrived a long chain of confessions.I hope this indicates the sort of enjoyment and escapism Patricia Wentworth's crime novels offer."

doc00463,book,train,"Much has been written about this author's thesis that the Chinese charted much of the world in the early 15th century.  In my view, the evidence is circumstantial and highly suspect, and the book is very lightly footnoted.  More importantly, though, this book reads as if it was written by, well, a submarine captain.  Interesting ideas are occasionally brought up, only to be forgotten in the next paragraph.  Many arguments are disjointed, leaving the reader to scratch his head when trying to understand how the author arrived at certain conclusions.  In one chapter, the author digresses into a story about an African safari that ended when an enraged hippo threw a boat over the author's head!  Gavin Menzies may indeed have discovered some compelling evidence for China's exploration of the world in 1421-1423, but he should have hired a real writer to help him make that evidence convincing."

doc02043,book,train,"The Gentleman Poet is as engaging as the author herself. Kathryn Johnson came to our book club to share her passion for this lovely novel, and she was interesting and enthusiastic. I liked the novel the first time, but even more after listening to her. She has written over 40 novels under various pen names, but this is the first she published under her own name. Although marketed as adult historical fiction, the book has also been embraced by the young adult audience winning the 2011 Booksellers' Best Award for young adult fiction.Kathryn Johnson became intrigued with a gap in Shakespeare history, a time when Shakespeare is unaccounted for in England and a man named William Strachey survived a shipwreck. His accounts of the shipwreck are eerily similar to Shakespeare's The Tempest, the last play Shakespeare wrote alone according to historians. Coincidence? Not in the author's eyes.The story centers on Elizabeth Persons, a young servant girl traveling on a ship heading to Jamestown and the New World. She has already survived family tragedy, and now finds herself shipwrecked in the Bermudas with an overbearing mistress and people frantically trying to survive.She is immediately drawn to a reclusive poet named Will. He spends his days journaling the passengers' attempts at survival. He senses a story in Elizabeth and takes her under his wing. His concern for her leads to matchmaking and a desire to see Elizabeth end up with Thomas, the ship's cook. Elizabeth soon discovers two things: Will is actually William Shakespeare, and she's worthy of love and Thomas. Through her relationship with both men, Elizabeth finds herself and becomes determined to control her own destiny.Don't let the title fool you. This is a love story and tale of survival, the character of William Shakespeare serves only as a catalyst. Historical fiction, romance and young adult readers will all enjoy the tale. Shakespeare fans, too, as they will appreciate the reference to his works. Each chapter begins with a quote from one of his plays.There are moments of laughter, tears, fear and applause. Women everywhere will celebrate Elizabeth, a strong woman before her time, one that cannot be held down by circumstance. You will laugh with her, cheer for her and cry with her in the end."

Enron's death spiral lasted just 24 days since the uncovering of the scandal.  Too bad it wasn't in late 2008, because the government would probably have bailed them out, just like AIG, Citi, and Fannie and Freddie Mae.  Thousands of people lost their jobs, billions were lost in investments as educated idiot constructed legal entities that broke the company.  Too boot, Fastow named his entities off of movie and television series characters.  The authors wrote in a convincing style, and made sure all the accusations were right.This is a good book about Enron.  I think the best is ""The Smartest Guys in the Room"".  That was a great book.  In this book, you can learn the death of a large company in a short time.  It didn't need to happen, except for the poor ideas and depravity of a corporate accountant."

However, I found that it is the type of book that has kept me up because I keep wanting to see what happens next.  It is also the type of book that causes one to pause and reflect on which aspects in the characters are a part of the reader as well.As far as style, I really like the way the author weaves together story lines of several different people using both flashbacks and current writing.  Over the arc of the story the various details build into a tightly woven piece.  That component reminds me of a John Irvine or Pat Conroy book.  However, the writing is faster paced.I think this book will appeal to a wide range of people.  Ironically, my biggest complaint is that I think she may have gone a little overboard with bringing up Ann Arbor details.  It helps for a local, but I think repeated references to certain streets or ""the diag"" might a get a little distracting if I were not local.  Then again, maybe I only notice it because I am local.

The story promised a lot, but gave far more. It is a true adventure about a bachelor finding family - the families of abandoned children he met in Nepal, and also the family of his own he was about to create.This book is a treasure. The writing style is breezy and conversational. It is the easiest thing to read that I've ever picked up, and the hardest to put down. The portraits he creates of the children he met in Nepal are warm and close, like sitting beside them. It is difficult to imagine these same boys and girls were victims of child trafficking, and that many more cases like these remain unsolved. I have mixed feelings about people traveling to distant lands where they don't speak the language and don't know the customs, planning to make a change for the better. But Conor frames these issues of foreign origins and charity in his story with humor and honesty.

doc02423,book,valid,"A Thread Across the Ocean: The Heroic Story of the Transatlantic CableThe Nineteenth Century saw massive growth in America's industrial infrastructure.Railroads criss-crossed the nation, factories grew up in New England and the mid Atlantic manufacturing shoes, clocks, guns, furniture, steel and machinery for making more products. Communications were vastly better with the telegraph than with its predecessor, the Pony Express, but messages still took days and weeks to cross the Ocean.Then, in the 1800's, along came Cyrus West Field, an original entrepreneur who made his fortune in the paper manufacturing business. An expert organizer and lobbyist, Field enlisted the support of other businessmen on both sides of the Atlantic in forming the organization that funded and designed the project.It took twelve years of cajoling and massaging investors, several abortive attempts to lay the cable, and millions of wasted dollars before Field and his team of engineers finally succeeded. On July 27, 1866, when the wire was finally in place, Field sent back the first message to Europe: ""Thank God,"" he wrote, ""the Cable is Laid."" Since that day, almost 140 years ago, nothing has broken his communications link with Europe -- not storms, earthquakes or world wars,It took a consortium of businessmen on both sides of the Atlantic, Acts of Congress, persistent lobbying, and constant innovation with material and techniques. (The cable was insulated with Gutta Percha, a rubber-like substance from the Far East that required the harvesting of most of the world's Gutta Percha crop to build the cable)The cable couldn't have been laid without The Great Eastern, at the time, and for many years afterward, the biggest ship in the world.  At over 700 feet, she was enormous, requiring two separate power sources, a conventional marine engine and a paddlewheel.  The Great Eastern had a rocky (literally) career: she was disabled by a boiler explosion and nearly sunk when she hit an uncharted rock in the entrance to New York Harbor. The only thing that saved her was the double hull. She carried troops and supplies during the Civil War.But the Great Eastern came into her own when Field's company enlisted her to lay the three-thousand-miles of cable from Newfoundland to Great Britain.  She later became a floating billboard for a British department store and took tourists aboard for a fee.  One of them was Jules Verne, who wrote a book ""A Floating City""A Floating Citybased on his trip."

doc05092,book,train,"I picked this up wanting to read about the guy's experiences at the movies.  Which movies did he like?  Which ones did he not like?  What does he have to say about the current movie going experience?What I got was a book that is just a little too high-concept for its own good.  In most of the 52 chapters, Murphy teases the reader with a list of movies he saw that week - but then he very rarely says a thing about those movies.  Instead, he talks in one chapter about crappy movie seats, or in another about theater food - you see, each chapter has to have its own movie theater related theme.  What this ends up being is just a lot of kind of boring fluff filler when what I really wanted to read was what he thought of &quot;Legally Blonde&quot;.That said, there were some amusing moments - like when he sneaks in an entire Thanksgiving dinner in a heavy coat (with tons of sewn-in pockets) or when he takes 6 different women (on 6 different nights) to see &quot;Serendipity&quot; (which he didn't much like - thanks for telling us Kevin!).Not bad to check out from the library - but I wouldn't keep it on my shelf."

doc06091,book,train,"I would rather have Bechtel take over my municipal water supply then have these 'lucky' girls come and live, or even worse, try to give aid, in my third world country.In one of the two stories I could get through, a comfortably well off family goes to Bangkok to visit its daughter, Mandy, who is volunteering at an AIDS orphanage.On principle, this really bothered me. Mandy is not a doctor, so what is she really doing at the Thai AIDS orphanage except getting in the way while getting to feel morally superior and enjoy an exotic country?  I find that kind of charity work - exotic and chic in its slumminess and rejection of bourgeoisie comforts - really self serving, and not very useful. Let's recognize it for what it is.She is so painfully politically correct that she has zero character judgment. After she springs her slimy, no account Thai boyfriend on the family, she takes her mother to task (which you could tell she was just dying to do) for not appearing to like him, even though the mother's only prior exposure to him had been when Mandy called her to tell her he had raped and hit her.  When her mother finally gets Mandy alone, Mandy basically responds ""Oh, when I called you all hysterical that time? He didn't really rape and hit me. It was just a cultural misunderstanding. And don't you dare judge him! You just don't like him because you're a racist xenophobe! I reject your bourgeoisie lifestyle and values! You can't possibly understand what a deep, meaningful experience I'm having in this rich culture while I make the world a better place at the same time! So there!""Another story involves a twentysomething homewrecker who lingers in India long after her lover dies, just hanging around, blowing off her brother's wedding back in the states, being a painful reminder to her lover's mother and his family. The story ends when she finally dares to tell the dead lover's mother that she, the young American mistress, should have been summoned to see him after he fell ill and was surrounded by his wife and children. Sorry, but as a mistress you don't have that right, you disrespectful tramp.Most of the girls reminded me of those insufferable girls who would return from their semester abroad and claim not to remember the American English word for various common items, or even worse, speak in a different accent for a few days until they were finally shamed into dropping it. But these are the girls who decided to remain abroad and become expats.You go away, girls."

doc05995,book,train,"Ms. Horne gives us an introduction to witchcraft that is fun to read and full of useful information. Her magic is a little Wicca-flavored, but it's not overpoweringly Wiccan, and thus can be applied by non-Wiccans as well. She approaches one of the major ethical issues of magic by offering her opinions on cursing (she disagrees with the practice for some very compelling reasons), but also provides some curses and lets the reader make his or her own decision--a decision many Witch/Wiccan authors don't seem to trust their readers with. She also provides some recipes dor herbal shampoos and other cosmetics--these aren't necessarily related to Wicca or witchcraft, but they're interesting nonetheless, and fun.While I disagree with some of her methods (invoking deities willy-nilly in spells), I would definitely recommend this book to someone looking for a good introduction to witchcraft, especially if they, like me, are not Wiccan. Of course, as with any introductory text, I would recommend going beyond it and reading other books, but Horne's book is a good place to start."
doc00423,book,valid,"Review originally posted on The Book Addict's GuideTo continue my kick with male POVs, I was hoping UNDERCURRENT by Paul Blackwell would hit the spot. I had seen a lot of mixed reviews, but right from the start, I was really enjoying Callum&#8217;s voice and his perspective. I don&#8217;t know what it is, but male POVs just really sound authentic to me &#8212; well, good ones anyway &#8212; and I think I read soooo many female protagonists that a good male character is just so well-appreciated!So in UNDERCURRENT, Callum knows he went over the falls near his house and survived&#8230; But doesn&#8217;t remember anything about how it happened and why his life is so different from what he &#8220;left&#8221;. His family acts entirely different, stores are missing, his friends aren&#8217;t the same, and even he is being treated like he&#8217;s a totally different person. I was curious to see exactly what would happen because clearly the story was leading somewhere but I was really suspicious as to where&#8230;I had peeked at a few reviews that compared it to The Butterfly Effect, so obviously I knew something similar was up, but it really wasn&#8217;t quite as psychological as that and didn&#8217;t jump around as much as that movie had. I really can&#8217;t say if it was because I had this expectation that I felt like the book moved a bit slowly or if it was just that I wasn&#8217;t as into it as I had hoped. There were a lot of questions brought up and Callum only slowly gets answers. It wasn&#8217;t so much of a story about how to fix his current situation so much as figuring out what happened to him and how he got there so I think I was hoping for just so much more action and less set-up. Either way, I did enjoy what I read, and even though I tried to keep my expectations a little bit lower due to very mixed ratings amongst friends, I still found myself not as into the book as I had hoped.I really wanted a bit more character development as well. Obviously since Callum&#8217;s entire world has been turned upside down, we&#8217;re mostly in his head, spending time with his thoughts and surroundings. That allowed very little opportunity to really explore other characters and get to know them since they&#8217;re not even the people he once knew, and I think as great as that concept for a story line is, it made it hard for me to really connect with the book because I wasn&#8217;t really able to connect with the characters at all.I did enjoy UNDERCURRENT, but my feelings do still fall somewhere in the middle. It was an interesting read, but it wasn&#8217;t something that made a lasting impression on me. I think others could enjoy it too, but it&#8217;s not really something that&#8217;s going to blow you away."
doc06387,book,train,"Like a previous reviewer, I found myself wanting to like this book more than I did.  But, ""Minutes to Burn"" is far too long, and filled with useless description and repetitive sequences.  A blend of every sci-fi/horror cliche of the past twenty years, the novel starts off well, but gets bogged down by a little too much technical garbage, and scenes that seem padded to expand the characterizations.  Unfortunately, most of the characters in this book are not that likeable.  Once again, we are treated with a Sigourney Weaver pair of female warriors, one black, one white.  Szabla is so obnoxious in her braggodocio that I wanted to slap her several times; meanwhile, the tough Cameron is such a self-centered, whining brat that she and her husband Justin come across as the Ken and Barbie of the future.  Savage is such a pompous and evil, insensitive character that one can't find much in him to admire.  That leaves Tucker and Tank as the only real likeable SEALS, and poor Derek goes off so weirdly, and becomes a father figure to the larva of one of the monsters.  Needless to say, Daddy doesn't fare too well.  Through the novel, we learn that Derek's child died a horrible death, obviously at the hands of its mother, but in the revelatory scene, we aren't really told WHAT the heck happened.But, nonetheless, the last section of the book does move better, and the action sequences are very well developed.  The inevitable sequel looms, but I don't think Hurwitz has anywhere to go with this one.Not a horrible read, but not one I'd recommend at this time."
doc06888,book,valid,"Disclaimer: before even starting to begin to read a novel about Miami, I have to personally untangle myself from the unseemly misconceptions I have about the city; for my own personal experiences have not been kind. I suppose I probably quite wrongly assume that these three things are required in order to be counted as a person in the city of Miami: a) that one have oodles of money (no matter where it comes from b) that one is exceedingly beautiful and c) one must be both of these things or in quick daily constant pursuit of these things and if not, then d) one simply is nothing, no one and never will become much of anything, in Miami. I am willing to assume this may not be entirely true. I also suffer from some admittedly American delusional prejudices that push me in the direction of thinking of one is Cuban or from Latin America, and living in Miami, then one can literally do and get away with any and almost anything--scratch the almost and just go with literally, one can and does get away with anything. Maybe it's all that clickety click fast talking Spanish that has me shaking my head and not comprehending. Though how beautiful and lush it is.Yes! -- Miami is a hub of culture. Yes! -Miami is a beautiful city. I will give Miami that. At what cost?I suppose I will refrain from answering. And having presented this disclaimer I am also willing to admit that maybe I am prejudiced because of the a)high crime rate in Miami b)inability of at least 50% of the population to learn and speak standard English(not that other languages are bad, but remember this is still the USA and I still would like to be able to speak English in the good old USA and c) that my personal bad experiences in Miami are still little needles of pain jabbing at me whenever I get too close to the sun. Ouch!And then I went and picked up Stiltsvile, and realized that I am not the only one who see's the disparity between the wealthy and the poor and the honest and the criminal. And that there are families, honest and true trying hard to live the American Dream in such a decadent place as Miami and that many are simply unable to make those dreams into something even resembling fruition. So there was a whole lot of Aha! Moments while reading Stiltsvile, and I am thankful to Ms. Daniel for that.For any person who is landlocked this summer and wishes they could just get away from it all, this book is for you!  I could very happily dive in for another swim if only for a reunion with such loveable characters and storyline.  There is a sense of rambling through the curtain of dark mangroves, alligators roaring with toothy grin, and the stilt house magically grows inside the soul pulling the waves alongside.  There are meager swells, and sea salt air, my neck grew damp with humidity and sweat and pictures of a family and a couple working hard to keep their marriage together grew up and all around me. Truly the mark of an extremely good writer! Creating imagery and making imagery come alive is no easy task.There is a brief mile marker that truly is a significant choice that Dennis and Frances have to make whether to move into uncharted criminal territory (just to have a nice boat ((what will it be next time? A newer and bigger house)), yet the couple rights themselves and sails down clearer seas, all the while still struggling. I did feel a tinge of disparity between people in Miami who lost everything they owned, and this novel's couple who had two homes and lost one. One that was a family paradise and getaway, but still, owning one home is far better than owning none. And they didn't have to live in the tent in Homestead either. So, there was a bit of thinking, all isn't splitsville or even sorryville for this family.Nonetheless, Dennis's struggle to find meaningful work for most of his life is real and very relatable, as is Frances's struggle to keep from cheating with Jack, as is Margot's impossible battle with the mean girls at Sunset. Much of that section of the book, Margot's struggle reminds me of my own teenage troubles in Kendall, and I wonder if the school systems just don't work very hard on helping kids through this difficult period? Meanness just so abounds. This leads me back to harping on the culture, because I truly believe it is the shallowness of the pursuit of riches and beauty at all costs and this emphasis that that is all that matters, or makes one worthy of being counted in this lifetime that is part of Miami's problem. I do think Miami has a bit of a problem in this arena. And truthfully, I don't have a whole lot of guilt about saying that either. Sorry for the commentary.Ms. Daniels does not hesitate from sharing the truth either, and I think that is commendable, as she is literally from Miami. So that takes courage. Dennis and Frances' valiant effort to stay together, a true testament to the power of marriage.The ending is extremely sad and really sneaks up on the reader, and requires a box of Kleenex. It truly does. And I think the way everyone came together as opposed to coming apart, when Dennis is suffering is another fine example of how families can work together even in the final terrible hours of departure.So, jogging back to what I said about Miami. Who knows, anything is possible. Enduring love is possible; surviving in Miami without being all of those shallow things,(amazingly)is also possible.That's why Change is such an attractive color when held up to humanity."

doc01569,book,train,"In my teacher observations over the past year and a half, I have come to the conclusion that the problem with our schools is the teachers.  Most are pessimistic about their students and have either lost their faith or never contemplated their spirituality.  This book is the best book I have read concerning the profession of teaching.  It has given me the strength to seek truth and not conform to the educational system in place.  The author talks about education as a spiritual journey.  Although his faith is of the Christian religion, he is neither dogmatic nor unscientific.  Mr. Palmer is very appealing to all the religions, and he is also very knowledgeable.  People of all spiritual practices will enjoy this book (I happen to be more into all the religions but tend to be more interested in the eastern religions).  His views remind a lot of Ghandi.  He is definitely a revolutionary man and teacher alike.  Mr. Palmer explains the danger of the one-sided views of objectivism and subjectivism.  He suggests that a mixture of the two is needed.  He talks about the new physics (quantum mechanics) and gives several other resources to explain his views.  The author reveals the simple truth that the best way to learn is in a nurturing community. Palmer reveals many of the problems with the current system. He also reveals some information about his own spiritual struggle and errs of teaching.  This book is a must read for teachers, students, and life-long learners."

doc00247,book,valid,"Originally reviewed at Tempting ReadsStealing Home, up until the last few chapters, was not a bad read. It was funny, with a good sense of comedic timing similar to Rachel Gibson, and in no way a serious read. It was pure entertainment. The writing and pacing were on point and the story was a unique take on close contact developing into something more. I liked the small glimpses of baseball the author provided too. I never felt the sports parts came across as overwhelming or inaccurate. Of course, I am sports illiterate, so I wouldn't have known if the author described something wrong or not.

doc07991,book,valid,"Since I love Follett's historical epics (The Pillars of the Earth, Fall of Giants, etc) so much and I love thrillers, I figured I should try one of the types of books that originally made him famous.After being disappointed by the last WWII thriller I read (Simon Tolkien's Orders from Berlin), Eye of the Needle was what I'd been looking for! The plot centers around a fictional (but relatively probable) ""what-if"" scenario involving the lead-up to the Normandy invasion, which gave the book its historical depth.  It's also a fantastic page turner - with spies, MI5, murder, police work, and a side love story as well.My one small criticism is that I thought the Epilogue was contrived and unnecessary to the story - but you can just stop reading when the regular book ends, so it doesn't end up doing much harm.For more reviews, check out my blog, Sarah's Book Shelves."
doc02133,book,train,"Reading Kenneth Davis is somewhat like watching a re-run of an old TV show you have not seen in some time.  It is very entertaining and enjoyable but at the same time you're not learning anything new.  I did like some of his subject matter like the Bible War in Philadelphia which rarely sees coverage now and I also enjoyed the parts of the book which dealt with The Seminole War and treatment of Native Americans.Again, neither of those stories are new or even untold, but they do not get the coverage or telling that they used too so it is nice to hear about them again. Read this if you're really into history and want to read something different. It's a good read."
doc01792,book,valid,"I think whatever I say about this book won't do it nearly as much justice as I feel it deserves.  When you think about the plot, it seems like it has been done to death and that it's just a cliche.  But this author takes every expected outcome or reaction and twists it in an unexpected manner.  When you would normally see a dramatic moment or a villainous character, you don't end up with the expected.  It was so refreshing!Miranda was a simply awesome character.  She's a ""lowly shop girl"" who somehow catches the interest of Viscount Downing.  Their first encounters are full of playful banter and hidden innuendos.  I loved how Downing skewed things in his favor so that he had an excuse to see her again.  As their acquaintance deepens, Miranda cannot help but feel that Downing has cultivated their friendship for another purpose, but she quite rationally thinks it through and decides to risk it anyway.  Miranda is an optimist, but she's also very pragmatic and realistic.  There were a few moments in the story where I expected her to react with high drama, but she didn't.  She took the time to think things through and decide what she was willing to accept and what the motivations of the offender were.  I couldn't help but love her for it.Downing was quite fascinating.  When we got further into the story and discovered his hidden motivations, I just wanted to smack him upside his head, and then cuddle him.  That man needed love.  He was constantly plotting and maneuvering, but he was afraid to trust it when he finally achieved his goal.  His dual nature was so sad.  He had incredible self loathing, but he desperately wanted someone to see him and love him for who he was.  I was so devastated for both him and Miranda toward the end.  The anguish and yearning that was shown in that final scene in the bedroom...it killed me.I loved how there were no villains in this story.  Even though there were characters who caused issues and problems for their family, they were still sympathetic.  Also, there was a situation involving a woman that I felt was handled extremely well.  I was afraid she would turn into a caricature, but the author held true to her determination to make every character feel real and understandable.At times the writing was quite poetic and lyrical.  Downing was the biggest cause of that.  He liked to seduce Miranda with his words, and he had quite a compelling turn of phrase.  The sexual tension in this book was excellent.  The characters don't have sex until far into the book, but I'm glad they didn't.  I really enjoyed watching them seduce each other with their conversation and their personalities.  It made their final capitulation so much more meaningful and sexy.This book wasn't dark and angsty, but it wasn't light and irreverent.  It felt like a nice balance of all those factors depending on the requirements of the scene.  There were times it was humorous and cute, and times it was powerful and sexy, but it was also tortured and dark too.  I like that it couldn't be easily typecast.I cannot wait to try more by this author.  I can only hope that I enjoy them as much as I liked this one."

doc08196,book,valid,"This book was amazing. Easily my favorite Warriors book. It's also the sadiest. At one part I was in the car with a couple of friends, and one of them asked me why I was sobbing!Anyways, the book starts as a flood sweeps through the RiverClan camp, at the same time Crookedstar's mother, Rainflower, starts kitting. Her mate, Shellheart, and the medicine cat, Brambleberry, get her into an oak tree. She gives birth to two kits, who she names Oakkit, after the oak that sheltered her, and Stormkit, after the storm that drove them there. Shellheart then remarks it was a shame that they couldn't both be leaders of RiverClan.As the next chapter starts, it becomes clear that Stormkit is very adventurous, and, Riverflower, instead of scolding him when he falls off a brach sticking over the river and needs to be rescued, she praises him for being brave.Sometime later, Stormkit and Oakkit sneak out of camp, and go over to SunningRocks. The current ThunderClan medicine cat, Goosefeather, is there gathering herbs, andStormkit decides to try annd scare him off. Instead, Goosefeather chases them back onto the Stepping Stones, and Stormkit falls and slamms his jaw on a rock. A tortoiseshell cat apperes in the water  in front of him, and tells him it is not his time to die.Stormkit later wakes up in the medicine cat den, and finds out he broke his jaw. His mother, Rainflower, refuses to see him, and has Hailstar, the current leader of RiverClan, change Stormkit's name to Crookedkit.Soon, Oakkit is made an apprentice, but Crookedkit is not. Feeling like he has no place in RiverClan any more, he runs away, wanting to go to the MoomStone bit instead staying at what in the future will become Barly and Ravenpaw's farm. After staying a moon, the tortoiseshell, who he thins is from StarClan, has learned is named Mapleshade, tells him to go back to his Clan, which he does. Later, she tells him he willl be leader one day, and makes him promise to put his clan above all other things. He agrees.This is only the first few of many wonderfull capters.

I love Feist, and Wurts/Feist combined remains one of my all-time favorite trilogies.Wurts writes female characters very well. They feel real, and not contrived. They have real emotions and deal with real issues, without reducing them to stereotypes, the princess who needs rescue, the evil conniving woman, the hysterical victim.This is the first volume of a follow-up to a very good trilogy, set centuries back, yet has the same characters due to their long lives.This ""fast forward"" affords us a chance to remain with the basic underlying premise of the earlier trilogy, but set with new dilemmas and problems facing our heroine.If you like Wurts, and you like this series/setting, then you'll definitely want to pick up this book."

I read quickly because I wanted to know how the mystery unfolded itself but as the story moves on you can tell one of the twists easily.

For example, Dag IS a Scandinavian goddess:Dag (Scandinavian) Goddess of the day; daughter of Nat, goddess of the night. Dag rides across the heavens on her horse, Skenfaxi, whose mane shines so brightly that it lights heaven and earth.There are also several sources that claim Idun was born of flowers.  Even if this is not an agreed aspect of Idun, such a minor account doesn't detract from the excerpt about her.Regarding Voluspa, she is a goddess and it is possible that her name is another for Freyja.  Her name means ""gold intoxication.""The myths that surround the gods and goddesses were not intended to reflect modern feminist attitudes.  It is unwise to change aspects of ancient gods because they assail the modern thinking of some.Don't let misinformation sway you from getting this delightful book.  It is not a book of ancient history or an encyclopedia of goddesses; it is book to help the reader begin each day with wonderful inspirations that will set the tone for one's day."
doc00322,book,valid,"If you've enjoyed Will Adams' earlier novels then you are sure to enjoy this sequel.  If not, then you really should read the earlier stories or at least ""The Lost Labyrinth"" to get the most out of ""The Eden Legacy"".Madagascar is a refreshing break from the Eastern Mediterranean past, as Daniel Knox works to establish his new life with a new identity after his earlier activities have left him with a massive price on his head.  Will Adams evocatively conjures up the people and the unique island environment as he again uses his hero to bring to light interesting challenges to accepted maritime exploration history, along with the usual treasure to again portray the fight between greed and knowledge.Thankfully, there are less characters to keep straight than in his earlier works as the story builds to the trademark exciting climax, with many twists and turns along the way.  I found some annoying editorial slips detracted occasionally, but otherwise this was a thoroughly enjoyable read."

doc07716,book,train,"I bought this book because I had read ""Saving Graces"" and wanted to see if Gaffney's power with the written word would be consistent.I also find myself tired of seeing so many books that are solely based on romance. Is that all women care about? Not this one.Gaffney has an exceptional talent for inhabiting the mind of her characters and speaking distinctively as she writes each character.All three protagonists in this novel are strong, complex, likeable and dislikeable.All three are real.All three are dealing with a variety of players, different challenges in different stages of life.  It was effortless to feel compassion, anger, laugh and cry with each of them.While the main point of the book is to be a study of the relationship of three generations of women in the same family, I saw it as an additionally strong study in personal evolution through challenging situations and everyday situations.I saw the responses as realistically human just as each character was realistically human.Some examples of Gaffney's word weavings which I found especially enjoyable:page 66:""Brian's job becoming, at least it had accomplished what my mother, guilt over Ruth, and 50 milligrams of Zoloft hadn't been able to: my return to the real world.  Half of me might be in the ether, zoned out and inattentive, mired in the old grief and guilt that a death in the family brings - naturally - but the other half was coping.  It was a start.""page 101:""Sex weas different -- he could and did make love in the face-to-face position -- but for everyday, standing-up, fully clothed affection he literally couldn't face me.""Ruth, the youngest woman, made this observation that stirred me:""My mouth was making too much water, I couldn't swallow fast enough.""

I love that, it is her style and the tone she has used from the very fist book she wrote; ""Assasin's Aprentice"".

Westcliffe's father died when he was five, and his inheritance was a run down estate and a marriage contract with Claire's father which bonded him to the Earl of Crestmont's firstborn daughter.  Westcliffe was to receive a hefty dowry when they married.  Westcliffe was eight years old when Claire was born.Stephen is Westcliffe's middle brother. Claire and Stephen were close, like sister and brother, as well as close in age.  They grew up in the countryside.  Claire told Stephen she was afraid to consumate her marriage.  Her mother died when she was young and her spinster aunt raised Claire.Stephen told Claire not to worry about her wedding night, that he would take care of everything.  Not knowing what Stephen was going to do, Claire waited in bed for Westcliffe. Stephen goes into the bedchamber, takes off his clothes and jumps into bed with Claire.  Westcliffe walked in, and assuming the worst, threw Stephen out of bed and knocked him out.  Then, he sent Claire back to Lyons Place in the country.Three years later, Claire went to London with her sister Beth so that Beth could have a season to find a suitable suitor. If not, Beth would have to married a wealthy man three times her age per her father's arrangement. Claire wasn't going to let that happen.  Claire went to see her husband. Westcliffe was shocked to see her in London and at his townhouse.  He wasn't happy Claire was in London.  He's been too busy chasing skirts.

Westcliffe agreed to help Beth with invitations to all-important balls.Claire went to London for another reason--To save her marriage.  Westcliffe's mistress, Lady Anne Cavil, was angry when she learned that Claire was living in his townhouse for the summer.  Lady Anne's role is a devilish, calculating one.  She'll do whatever it takes to get Westcliffe to leave Claire and marry her.Claire and Westcliffe was a wonderful couple once they were able to discussed the incident that happened on their wedding night and the fear she had.  Westcliffe admitted she was young and that he should have courted her before marriage. They were able to make their marriage work.  Surprisely for me,  I hadn't expected such a twist in the end.Second book in the series ""Pleasures of A Notorious Gentleman,"" involves Stephen Lyons,  Westcliffe's middle brother.

doc06869,book,train,"This book is an excellent study in the general progress of technology during the Middle Ages, debunking the centuries-old conventional wisdom that the period was somehow a step backwards or idling vis-a-vis the Romans. Proceeding chronologically from period to period, a convincing case is made by showing how particular developments built on each other step by step. If I had to find a quibble, it would be the very minor one that I expected a bit more on building technology, and that is very minor indeed.For those who are not already expert in medieval technology, but are generally interested in either medieval history or technological history, this is a must-read."
doc05072,book,train,"Let's focus on some matters not elaborated by the many reviewers of this encyclopedic book.In the permissive, hedonistic west, discipline and doctrine are often belittled. Weigel, in contrast, writes: ""To defend the truths of the Catholic faith was not to be `doctrinaire', it was to be doctrinally serious...He was the voice of an authoritative tradition."" (pp. 354-355). Furthermore: ""The pope is not an authoritarian figure who issues arbitrary decisions by virtue of his own unbridled will. The pope is the custodian of an authoritative tradition of teaching, a `magisterium', that defines the boundaries of the church. He is its servant, not its master."" (p. 264) The legacy of Pope John Paul II follows this path: ""To tens of millions of people, many of whom are not Roman Catholics, he is the great figure of our time, the defender and principal embodiment of a moral force that has led humanity safely through the bloodiest of centuries."" (p. 4). This book includes a compare-and-contrast list of seven areas in which the thinking of modernity is at odds with the Christian faith. (p. 489)The photographic collection of this book alone is priceless and timeless. For instance, there is a photo of Pope John Paul II visiting the tomb of murdered Father Jerzy Popieluszko in Poland, and one showing the ordination of now-Archbishop Stanislaw Dziwisz."

Generally, by the time you are Real, most of your hair has been loved off, and your eyes drop out and you get loose in the joints and very shabby.

Laermer and Simmons take a irreverent, no-holds-barred look at today's marketing landscape, and how consumers interact with advertising.  The days of throwing a 30 second ad on TV and calling it good are over.  There are so many media outlets clamoring for attention, and the advertising din has made it nearly impossible to stand out using traditional styles.  Furthermore, the old ad agencies no longer hold the power to control the market.  TiVOs have reworked the way people view a program, and the odds are high that your audience is fast-forwarding past your multi-million dollar ad budget.  Punk marketing looks at how nontraditional methods of marketing are needed to reach your specific markets.  Techniques such as viral marketing, cell phone interaction, and product placement in shows and movies are becoming the way to make a mark without just talking louder and longer.  But even these avenues are fraught with peril if you don't remember the attitudes of the persons being marketed to.  For instance, cell phone interaction can be great if it's participatory.  But if you just start sending repeated ads to a cell phone audience, you've sealed your fate.  Bottom line...  you have to be different in order to be seen, and you *will* make mistakes.  But standing pat on the past campaigns are becoming less effective with every passing year.Even if you're not necessarily involved in marketing, you'll enjoy the attitude of the writers.  I was reminded often of Tom Peters' style of writing with even more raw emotion.  I knew I was in for a different read when I hit the dedication page...  ""To everyone who's ever s**t-canned us...  and their spouses.""  That same in-your-face attitude carries through the entire book, and it makes for a compelling read.  The fact that they nail the attitudes and habits of today's consumer makes it great..."

And I never thought I would say this, but I'm hoping that the series will wrap in the next few books.The first three books were wonderful, but have taken on a totally different feel with ""City of Souls"" and now ""Cheat the Grave"". In ""Cheat the Grave"", Joanna Archer, formerly the Light's savior, must learn how to live as a mortal. After giving up her powers to save a mortal child, Joanna was abandoned by Warren, the only father she has ever known, and the troup she was beginning to embrace as her family. Even worse, Hunter has betrayed Joanna and chosen Solange and Midheaven over her. But Joanna and Hunter (or Jaden Jacks) still have a soul connection, which infuriates Solange. To exact her revenge, Solange has sent Mackie, a ruthless Shadow agent, to destroy Joanna.Joanna finds unlikely allies in former Shadows, who call themselves rogues, or Grays. Joanna must choose between creating a new future for herself, or return to the Light under Warren's control.The thing I like most about this series is that it's completely unpredictable. I never once suspected any of the revelations revealed in this book, and I have no idea nor will I even try to guess what will happen next.A few things I'd like to see: more Ben, more Zoe, Zoe and Warren, and more Joanna battling the Shadows.I hope in the next book we can take a trip back to the comic book shop, and that the manuals will get some more page time. And I also hope we can be done with Midheaven. Unfortunately, I just haven't enjoyed any of the plots with Midheaven, and both this book and City of Souls were thick with it. More Vegas, please!"

This book is about how a young innocent girl was neglected by her parents, brought into drugs and pornography, woke up, turned her life around, and became a success in everything she touched.  Her story provides hope and will change the way you look at Traci Lords again.  Great Book!!"
doc08489,book,valid,"It is very nice to see someone talk about business in a way that is touching and human. After all the huge scandals of rich business people screwing the little guy, reading about these heros is quite refreshing. It gives you hope that maybe there are still a lot of GOOD people left in this world.The stories are very personal, touching, and uplifting. I highly reccomend this book to everyone."
doc06605,book,train,"Now, I hadn't read anything by these authors before (they wrote The Nanny Diaries) so I wasn't sure what to expect, other than that the summary sounded cute.What I Liked: 1) Max. Max was very savvy for a seventeen year old. She's got a good business sense (other than taking payment in cookies, really). She is also very professional while she is helping other girls to get over their breakups. She was very well-developed, and that made it easy to get into the story. 2) Supporting characters - Zach, Phoebe and Bridget. Sometimes it's hard to imagine an MCs life because you don't get to know their friends. But this book was written as to show the reader the relationship between MC and supporting characters and how Max is influenced by her friends. 3) Ben. Loved Ben, I thought he was such a sweet guy, kinda the strong, silent type. I actually kind of got irritated at Max a little bit for how she was treating him. But it was also a really interesting way how their lives overlapped without them even knowing it for a while. 4) One shot, happy ending. I spend so much time in these other worlds, these supernatural worlds of speculative fiction stories, that I have come to really appreciate the happy ending of this realistic fiction piece. So many books that I read have bittersweet endings, like the happy comes with the sad, but I thought this one was just a good ol' happy ending. It was great.What I Didn't Like: Like I said before, I had some issues with how Max was treating Ben sometimes, but it was necessary, so it worked.Overall Thoughts: This was a sweet little one shot story with a happy ending that anyone can enjoy. If you're are looking for something light and fun with a happy ending, I'd definitely recommend picking up Over You. The characters are all very likeable, and the subject matter is something any girl (or guy) can understand and appreciate!"
doc04925,book,valid,Richard Foster has done an excellent job with this devotional.  Very easy to read and what a great way to begin the day.  It gives a lot to think about and we've given this book as gifts to those who are wishing to draw closer to the Lord.
doc07354,book,valid,"MEETING JESUS AGAIN FOR THE FIRST TIME is a book that is loaded with original thinking and deserves to be read more than once.Borg believes that Jesus did not think of Himself as the Son of God who came to die for the sins of the world and His message was not about believing in Him.According to Borg, Jesus was a spirit person, subversive sage, social prophet and movement founder. He invited His followers into a transformational relationship with the same Spirit that He Himself knew. Jesus encouraged people to join Him in a community whose core value was compassion. He wanted to move people from living in a world of conventional wisdom to a world centered in God.Furthermore, Borg does not regard Jesus as uniquely and exclusively the true revelation of God - but only as a unique revelation of God.What sets Borg apart from most other Jesus Seminar scholars is his emphasis on the Christian life as a journey towards a deepening and transforming relationship with God. Believing in Jesus does not mean believing things about Jesus. It is not about believing what the Gospels and the church say about Jesus. It means instead to give one's heart at its deepest level to the Post-Easter Jesus who is the Living Lord and also the Spirit."
doc01907,book,train,"I read this book several months ago, and have been lax in doing reviews until just recently, so I'll just talk about what I remember & let the rest go.I remember that I liked this book better than I first thought I might.  I remember the reason I thought I might not like it was because I thought it would travel to Egypt, so I was glad when itdidn't & stayed in London.  It is a very good mystery book, as well as a romance book, and set up the sequel, which is one of my all-time favorites, very nicely.  My friend at work read this after I did, and she read the sequel as well, but she actually liked this book better than the sequel.  I guess we're all different and what appeals to one of us might not appeal to the other, though we have similar tastes in books.One of the things I like in Jacquie's books is how she always has a running line throughout her books, which doesn't get old, but only lends more charm to her reads. I don't know how to describethis, other than you have to read her books & you'll see what I mean.  She gives the main characters their own special running joke throughout the book, and this is different in each book with each set of characters.  To me, it's her trademark, along with other cute things, like giving pets cute & imaginative names.It just helps endure me to her writing.I've read all of her books so far, except for ""Red Roses"", and my favorites so far are ""Love & The Single Heiress"" and ""The Bride Thief"".  Her hero in Love & The Single Heiress is one of my favorite heroes ever.1-10 scale for this book:  9.8"
doc02493,book,valid,"After breaking his neck bicycling down a hill at 12, the author somehow has to rebuild his life as a quadriplegic. Years of surgeries and rehab and trying not to hope too hard, but unable not to, leave him acerbic, witty, somewhat detached from life, yet desperately wanting, like all of us, to find his place.The author is fantastic at using few words to give a complete picture of a scene, and his writing is crisp and keeps you glued to the page. If you've enjoyed other literary memoirs, like Joan Didion's Year of Magical Thinking or Ann Patchett's Truth and Beauty, then you'll know the kind of analytical, emotional but never soppy or melodramatic, sparse yet beautiful prose you'll find here. It's the author's emotional journey to find his place in the world.What this book is not: it doesn't try to be inspirational or uplifting, and the ending doesn't feel complete in any real way. I kind of think the author's too young to finish a memoir, which could be good news if he writes another one as his life unfolds.I personally would have liked more - more details, more stories, I'd love his poetry to have been integrated into the book, and possibly some photos - it's a slim book and feels incomplete. But the writing is so crisp and beautiful, and the author's skill at observing life and portraying it in words makes this well worth the read."

I normally use it in my tea (Celestial Seasonings African Tea, Madagascar Vanilla Red, Tea Bags, 20-Count Boxes (Pack of 6)), but I have also put it on whole-grain waffles (and I've been known to just take a swig when I need a shot of something sweet).

You could buy better quality instant drink powder for a lot less and just use the keurig to make hot water.These were on sale, so I took a chance.  Mmm hmm, golden french toast from christmas, a bunch of powdered instant cappuccino, and plenty of decaf.That will pretty much do it for me for this particular brand.  I'd been hoping that with the torrents of bad reviews (the christmas coffees dominating the 'summer sampler' should have been the end) that they'd get the hint and stop putting the ultra cheap and out of season coffees and so much decaf in the boxes.

However, I have made a cup and then made a smaller cup with the same k-cup.  Even the second cup is pretty good.  This coffee might be the smoothest K-cup I've ever had, too.  Try it first without cream or sugar.  Just taste the Kona.  I wish all coffee beans smelled like this coffee.I may not order this again in a K-Cup.  At $2/cup it is quite expensive.  It is expensive enough that I feel guilty having a second cup of it.  No doubt you'd pay nearly this price for a bitter and stale cup of coffee from a coffee shop, though.  I might order the 100% Kona and grind my own to make it more budget friendly.  I ordered this via Prime and it arrived fairly quickly.  The two day Prime shipping that took 4 days is the only reason I take one star away.  I'd give this coffee 5 stars if not for the shipping.

They sit for a night in this marinade and the next day we use the meat for duck fajitas.

Odor was noticeable in bottle and on baby&#8217;s breath. Not bad, more like what adults notice with protein drinks.* After mixing Enfamil has a thinner consistency* Enfamil warms quickly in bowl of warm waterThe biggest difference was that our little guy didn't eat as much which meant more feedings.

However, I did need to take the gasket off and clean it.I saw in other K-cup reviews that gases that build up inside K-cups can cause this to happen and that the solution is to lower the top of the Keurig brew chamber just enough to puncture the top of the K-cup, lift the top again to allow the gases to escape, and then close as normal.  I tried this on the next Newman's Own K-cup, and it worked!  I'll do this with every K-cup from now on."

doc00761,food,train,"Its koshering salt, not really ""Kosher"" and it has not been blessed by aRabbi in a clean room in Haifa or somewhere, this is the salt used in thekoshering process to extract the last drops of blood from cured meats.Whats different between Diamond Crystal and Morton's? Well for one thingthere are no fillers or caking agents, and Morton's is ground rock salt,much coarser and less willing to dissolve than the fine flakes you findwith Diamond Crystal. Also DC is distinct from other kosher salts becauseof its extraordinary texture that easily crumbles between fingertips, itssmooth blendability and its exceptional adherence. Diamond Crystal is puresalt and has no additives.Ask any chef why they use kosher salt and they will tell you it tends tohave a clean, natural flavor and sprinkles more evenly than other salts.Also, this DC is half as saline as table salt by volume, while Morton's is2/3 as saline as table salt by volume. That means there is less probabilityof over-salting. The general usage table looks like this: 2 parts table salt= 3 parts Morton kosher = 4 parts Diamond Crystal kosher.Anyway, if you go to diamondcrystalsalt(dot)com under the Culinary tab you willfind the store locator for your area. Also on the website is a highly entertainingand informative ""Salt 101"" by Food Network's Alton Brown that will explain to youwhy you should be using Diamond Crystal Kosher, and how. Never understood whyDC is generally found in the kosher foods section of the grocery stores, while theMorton salt is in the spice aisle?This DC product was also awarded the American Culinary Federation Seal of Approval,which basically means this is the #1 choice of gourmets everywhere. Great stuff!And despite any silly claims in the comments section, there is no such thing as""Kosher"" salt, its ridiculous. Sorry. LOL"

Sadly, the Lazy Day Dark Chocolate Ginger Cookies don't clear this hurdle for me, though in fairness I'm not gluten intolerant, and these cookies may be ideal for someone who is.Like another reviewer noted, the cookies don't fare well in a hot mailbox (which isn't their fault, but did result in the cookies being welded together by melted chocolate). The cookies have a somewhat soft and chewy texture, and each has a half-dip of dark chocolate. Unfortunately, there's not enough ginger in these cookies for me to have identified them as ""ginger"" in any way without the label. Overall, the impressions I got were simply ""soft and sweet"" - and, in fact, TOO sweet.Considering their rather steep price, I'd pass on these in the future...though as I said, if it's really hard to find gluten-free cookies these might be worthwhile for someone who has more restricted dietary choices than I do."

doc02427,food,train,"In my desire to eat healthier and cook healthier for my family, one of the changes I decided to make for everyone's benefit is to cut back on salt/sodium, which we've been pretty heavy-handed with at times. There are so many foods/condiments we do eat that already have salt in them, I decided to try this No Salt Substitute in some of my cooking/baking, as well as with meals to use at the table. So far, my family and I have enjoyed our food as we always have, and we did not note a funny flavor (just a slightly different flavor) or any strange aftertaste (which frankly, I expected we might prior to use).Sprinkling it on (baked) french fries is just okay, but I do like that it has a similar consistency (granules) as salt. The fries are better with it than without it, but I think once we have been using this for a while longer, we will all get more adjusted to it. So far, we have used it on fries, chicken and vegetables. Even if everyone opts to use a little regular salt to sprinkle their foods, if I choose to replace this No Salt for the salt I would have normally used for cooking/baking, we will still be healthier for at least replacing some of our regular salt with No Salt. It does not taste just like salt, but it is more palatable than I thought it would be.

doc07471,food,valid,"As recommended on the packaging, I have used this sugar in baking projects paired with 'other strong flavors' such as chocolate.  I have made chocolate cake/bread in my mini bread machine and this sugar has added a deeper, more complex flavor.  It also added a little more moisture to my previously dry recipe.  I recommend using this in recipes that can handle a little extra moisture (when substituting for regular sugar), replacing part or all of the brown sugar in a recipe, in a recipe with chocolate or coffee, on in a recipe where the flavor would add a nice touch.  I bake Challah, Jewish Sabbath bread, and I have used this sugar to replace the small amount of sugar in the recipe.  It made the challah a little bit richer.  I like the jar that this sugar comes in.  Yes it is plastic, but it is nice and air tight.  I chose this packaging over several smaller plastic bags of Muscovado sugar because it was cheaper.  Either way, if one was concerned about plastic, it could be repackaged into glass at home."

doc05237,food,train,"Like a lot of other products by Barry Farms, I was first introduced to carob powder way back during my sons scouting days. Camping trips during the fall and winter months always resulted in the evening ending with a traditional ""jawin"" session around the fire, complete of course with hot cocoa and marshmallows, among other treats.  In the beginning, real hot chocolate was used for it was easy to locate, and of course what the boys wanted and expected.  The biggest problem we had with the real thing was the obvious caffeine high it used to give the boys late at night when we least wanted it.  (As any of you with youngin's in your household can imagine, most kids don't need the bountiful effects of caffeine at any time, but especially late at night).  After the traditional session around the campfire ended, a not so well liked and substandard other tradition would unfortunately follow.  Trying to get the well wired boys to settle down and let the old men and ladies on the trip get some much needed rest.Enter carob powder.  Carob is a tropical pod that contains a sweet dark pulp that is very similar in taste and texture to cocoa.  The pulp is dried and then ground into a powder that both appears and tastes similar to chocolate.  It used to be something only available in health food stores.  But now with the advent of the internet, it is widely available here and other places online.  Despite carob powder being very similar to chocolate in calories and fats, it is nonetheless a healthier alternative.  It contains three times the calcium found in chocolate, and more importantly to me, unlike chocolate it contains no caffeine.  This was the true benefit we had in mind in substituting it for the cocoa at trails end each night.  Make no mistake about it, carob is a little sweeter, but definitely not as flavorful as real chocolate ounce for ounce.  Anyone expecting hot chocolate will be disappointed by a straight mug of carob.  It's not only not as tasty, but it remains a little grittier as well when dissolved.  Surprisingly however, my experience back in my sons scouting days proved that the boys got used to the carob powder very quickly, and actually enjoyed its little grittier texture.  As for its flavor, straight carob brewed hot reminded a lot of the scouts of Yoo Hoo drink.  Anyone familiar with the taste of Yoo Hoo can easily imagine carobs flavor.  Even if we decided to spike the carob powder with a little real chocolate, we were still giving the boys a healthier drink, and of course a lot less caffeine. We went through quite a few pounds of it in my sons younger days.  With very few complaints or disappointment.In conclusion, I highly recommend carob powder for anyone that prefers a little healthier alternative drink to real hot chocolate, and without any of the caffeine. Or, if you just happen to be one of those poor unfortunates that is allergic to chocolate. I still today buy it from Barry Farms and take it along on my own hikes here for I am so used too, and have taken a liking to its flavor over the years.  If you decide to give it a try, I recommend buying two or more pounds at a time to make the shipping a better deal.  The Barry Farms carob is a very good quality product, and has been around for many years.PS:  By the way, like some of the other reviewers here, I recommend the regular or light carob powder over the dark brewed blend also available on Amazon.  Carob is not like chocolate in that it gets sweeter and stronger when roasted a bit longer. In my opinion and that of others here, it just gets more bitter and less pleasant by the lengthier process..."

It's more common than not to have it arrive with a small tear (usually at the end) and a bit of milk powder in the box.

A simple glass of V8 works perfectly. I've always loved V8 juice for that reason, but found it just a tad too salty. The low sodium version has made V8 perfect in my opinion. It has more flavor than most tomato juices, with a nice hint of celery seed. (It also makes a mean Bloody Mary!).

The chips themselves have a good texture.  They're a little greasy, as kettle chips tend to be, but most of the grease and mess are left behind in the bag, and on your fingers.

doc06774,food,train,"This CLASSIC COLLECTION BY BARRELS OF YUM contains an assortment of large, barrel-shaped hard candies in eight different adult flavors:  Chai Tea, Granny Smith Apple, Blueberry Crumble, Hot Cinnamon, Peach Cobbler, Orange Cream, Sour Watermelon, and Apple Pie.The candy flavors more or less match up with the names.  However, if you're looking for a particular flavor, it can be hard to pick it out by the color.  The brown Chai Tea closely resembles the lighter brown Apple Pie; and the pale orange Peach Cobbler, orange Orange Cream, and pinkish orange Sour Watermelon are very similar.  Blueberry Crumble was easy to find, but the blueberry flavor was disappointingly subtle.  Hot Cinnamon is quite good, although it surprised me because the red color made me expect cherry.  Granny Smith Apple does taste kind of like a tart apple.  Unfortunately, several of the flavors left an artificial aftertaste.These candies are the brainchild of David Klein (inventor of the Jelly Belly jelly bean), so it's no surprise that the experimental ""adult"" flavors are reasonably well done.  Barrels of Yum also sells a really interesting dill-pickle-flavored version of these barrel-shaped candies (seeDilly Dally).Three pieces of either version of candy delivers 90 calories, with 15g of carbohydrates including 11g of sugars.  The boxed candies are individually wrapped in cellophane.  The candies are fairly large (about 1-1/8"" long, 2-1/2"" around).

As I type this, I'm enjoying a bowl of Harvest Fruit for my dinner.  Hey, who says that cereal is strictly a breakfast food :) Good food can be enjoyed at any time!"

doc01037,food,valid,"24oz not 16oz of USDA certified organic chia and priced better than most. Calcium is the ingredient I consume chia for not omega-3 which there is none in chia anyway. ABC News has posted a video for chia claiming """"Be cautioned, you should only eat a small amount, maximum one ounce a day."""" Let's look at some facts since I like to get the most nutritious foods for the best price available.WEIGHT: One pound of muscle burns six calories per pound per day. One pound of fat burns two calories per pound per day. That four calorie difference may not sound like much, but for most people, that's the difference between living lean and living obese and even morbidly obese (defined by those who are 100 or more pounds overweight). Cardiovascular exercise will result in weight loss, but it will come at a cost as 60% of the weight loss will be fat (that's good!) while the remaining 40% will come from muscle (that's really, really bad!). After the age of 20, the average person loses one-half to seven-tenths of a pound of muscle a year. That's 5 to 7 pounds a decade. After the age of 70, the average person loses 3 pounds of muscle--per year! As women approach menopause, the rate at which they lose muscle doubles, which is why so many women begin to gain weight right around that time of life. Why is this weight gain happening? It's simple--muscle loss. When you lose muscle, your metabolism is destroyed. Your successful weight loss formula is dieting plus strength training. Period. No food helps you lose weight, it helps you gain weight. The only way to lose weight is to eat fewer calories, period.CHOLESTEROL: Cholesterol lowering drug, Lipitor with $13 billion plus in annual sales is a top selling drug in the world. Phytosterols which is helpful in lowering cholesterol can be found in many foods like sesame seeds, sunflower seeds, watermelon, onion... no Phytosterols in Chia seeds.FISH OIL, OMEGA-3(EPA/DHA): Greens, nuts, seeds, fruits and vegetables do not offer any omega-3(EPA/DHA) since it is an animal source. Flaxseeds offer more ALA than chia for $1.99 a pound not $15 a pound, 22.8gr vs. 17.8gr. There are two major types of omega-3 fatty acids in our diets: One type is alpha-linolenic acid (ALA), which is found in plants the other type, eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) and docosahexaenoic acid (DHA), is found in fatty fish. The body partially converts ALA to EPA and DHA. There is no proof what percent of ALA gets converted by human body to EPA or DHA. You can consume all ALAs that you want and depending to your genes it may never turn any into omega-3(EPA/DHA). Blood test is the only way to see the affects. I get omega-3 from sardines although flaxseed is important part of my diet since flax offers so many different nutrients. But more importantly Omega-3 to Omega-6 ratio for flax is 38.71 but for chia only 3.03.PROTEIN: No seed or green offers complete protein other than quinoa and soy. Soy is not my choice since soy is processed as soy milk and comes with estrogen. Chia is an incomplete protein since it is missing few amino acids. I get 25gr of complete protein with all amino acids in one scoop of pure isolate or 8gr from one cup of quinoa. Those are excellent amount of protein since after all human body does not digest more than 30gr of protein at a time.FIBER: There are two different types of fiber -- soluble and insoluble. Both are important for health, digestion, and preventing diseases.* Soluble fiber attracts water and turns to gel during digestion. This slows digestion. Soluble fiber is found in oat bran, barley, nuts, seeds, beans, lentils, peas, and some fruits and vegetables. It is also found in psyllium, a common fiber supplement. Some types of soluble fiber may help lower cholesterol, but the effect on heart disease is not known.* Insoluble fiber is found in foods such as wheat bran, vegetables, and whole grains. It adds bulk to the stool and appears to help food pass more quickly through the stomach and intestines.If you happen to have certain health issues especially digestion issues then insoluble fiber is what you would reach for but if you want to feel full for a longer period of time then soluble fiber becomes the priority. Fiber is essential for body since fiber absorbs the unwanted liquid in the gut and body has to defecate that blown up fiber which in return lowers cholesterol, blood pressure, etc. and brings comfort and efficiency to human body unlike fat which stays in human body. Chia is the highest fiber but with higher price and less nutrients.HYDRATION: Ask yourself, wouldn't you just be getting the same amount of water regardless whatever added to that water... Water helps hydration not chia or whatever added to water. Water is the best liquid to drink to hydrate but green tea, coffee and squash are also hydrating. When you drink coffee, your body is retaining much of that fluid - especially for people who are habituated to drinking caffeine, as the body adapts, resulting in a reduced loss of fluids. Chia has nothing to do with hydration and never helped hydration only a marketing tool.MONOUNSATURATED FATS: 7.5g in 100g serving of flax and only 2.1g for chia. Mono is the same healthy oil as you get in avocado fruit.Accordingly for 100gr servings size of;FENNEL__SESAME__FLAX__CHIA__AMARANTH__QUINOA__HEMP__PISTACHIO__ALMOND__CASHEWCALORIES345__565__534__490__371__368__567__557__575__553SAT FAT0__34__18__16__7__4__17__27__19__39CALCIUM%120__99__26__63__16__5__0__11__26__4MAGNESIUM%96__89__98__0__62__49__167__30__67__73POTASSIUM%48__14__23__5__15__16__167__29__20__19ZINC%25__48__29__23__19__21__83__15__21__39FIBER%159__47__109__151__8__11__4 __41__49__13PHYTOSTEROLS (mg)66__714__0__0__0__0__N/A__214__0__0CONCLUSION: With a healthy diet of seeds, nuts, fruits and vegetables, the last thing on my mind is FIBER, a fiber with constipation when I can get healthy fiber in many food items for $2 not $10 a lb with chia's unwanted high CALORIES, lack of many micro-nutrients and especially with upset stomach as claimed correctly by ABC NEWS (link provided in comment section). Despite all the claims, chia does NOT even break down that easily in the stomach due to its shape and size just like many other seeds so I ground chia just like I do with all other seeds. Chia is sold for $15 lb in WF bulk section which is 30% more than Amazon while everything else in WF bulk section sells for LESS than anywhere since majority pay attention to marketing not Nutrition Facts... I consume chia for calcium in organic form in very limited amount since as I described, it is very expensive for limited nutrients but I need to get as much calcium as possible from DIFFERENT foods. I consume higher amounts of hemp, fennel, sesame, flax, amaranth, quinoa than chia. For calcium it is acceptable to me but in general chia not on top of my list."
doc00769,food,train,"Pearl couscous, the larger type of couscous, is nicely textured with a firm or al dente type of consistency. I believe this is also called Israeli couscous. Similar to a pearl pasta but heartier and chewier (in a good way).I tried several of the different SideMates products and found them all to be very good in quality, nutritional value (ingredients and calorie count), and ease of preparation (essentially just boiling and simmering). The sodium content was maybe just a teensy bit higher than I would like but you don't actually taste it. The seasoning levels were very good overall. Box says three servings but dividing by three seemed odd especially since the serving size (1/3) was large-ish. I think this is easily four nice sized servings.The Tuscan Medley was one of my favorites of the different flavors I tried for the Amazon Vine program. Overall, I prefer the pearl type couscous over the traditional couscous mostly for the texture and a sense of eating something a bit more substantial than the traditional type.These sides are nice to have around for those nights when you need a little extra something for dinner.Recommend."

doc01132,food,train,"I could not use any of the not-to-be-named pre-Splenda sweeteners. I simply could not tolerate their taste AND the aftertaste. I've been a Splenda user ever since it became available - 10 years? - because... well... the taste is VERY close to sugar's own and, as far as I know, there are NO side effects.My understanding of the Splenda technology is that the process starts with what is supposed to be a 'sugar' molecule and then ONE atom is replaced with another which makes it impossible to digest so it simply passes through your digestive tract. You get zero calories, good taste and no side effects.So... what's not to like? The price? That's were the wisdom of buying these large but not too heavy Splenda boxes comes from.I NEVER put anything sweet into my tea or my coffee - a habit I probably developed during those dark, sad, pre-Splenda days - but, when it comes to Cappuccino... it's a different story. I am reaching for the little yellow packets. A box of these lasts me for a long, long time. When it comes to cooking, the Splenda is calibrated to be the equivalent of sugar by volume. In other words, a cup of Splenda is used whenever the recipe calls for a cop of sugar."

doc02962,food,valid,Like another reviewer I had previously been buying Seapoint dried edamame for a long time but I've been told that they have simply stopped making it. So I got Ann's House Edamame and boy is it wonderful! It's a terrific source not only of taste -- and the taste is to die for -- but a significant source of protein: a 1/4 cup serving yields 11g protein. As well as fiber: 5g per serving. As an ovolacto-vegetarian it's important that I get enough protein and it turns out I use edamame a lot. One of my favorite ways to use it is to stir a serving into a pot of yogurt. This makes a terrific breakfast or late-night snack.Scott Morrison

These taste about the same, but are available *much* faster. With the frozen kind, you spend all that time cooking them just to get them to room temperature... you rehydrate these with a cup or so of boiling water, so they're getting ready to cook during the rehydration time.

For cocktails the syrup is too thick for my taste.The cherries are small, about half the size of the Maraschino cherries found in most stores.

doc08674,food,train,"Canola oil was developed through hybridization of rape seed.Canola is a made-up word which stands for ""Canadian oil low acid"", and is a genetically modified product.It is a Canadian invention that is backed by the government.It's a cheap product to manufacture, and many processed or packaged foods contain canola oil.Canola oil was first bred in the early 1970&#8242;s as a natural oil, but in 1995 Monsanto created a genetically modified version of canola oil. By 2009, 90% of the Canadian crop was genetically engineered and as of 2005, 87% of canola grown in the United States was genetically modified.Facts You Should Know About Canola Oil >>>>>>>>>>>The name of canola oil was originally LEAR (Low Erucic Acid Rapeseed) but for marketing purposes was changed to canola oil. This word was derived from the combination of the phrase, ""Canadian oil."" Canola oil is a much more appealing name than LEAR oil or rape oil. But is the oil appealing for you and should you be using it in your foods?Canola Oil is produced from the rapeseed plant, which is a part of the mustard family. It works well as an industrial oil, not a food, and has been used in candles, soaps, lipsticks, lubricants, inks and biofuels. In it's hybridized and modified state it can cause a large number of health issues that you will see below.Now that we have figured out how to genetically modify rapeseed oil, we sell it as an edible product. It has been brought to market with the claim that it is a wonder oil, that is low in saturated fats, and has omega-3 fatty acids. Originally, rapeseed oil may not have had so many negative health effects but for two main reason's most canola oil today is harmful to you body:#1 Over 90% of Canola Oil is genetically modified#2 Canola Oil is a partially hydrogenated oilIt's for these two reasons I recommend you switch to healthier oil alternatives that I list at the conclusion of this article.What can it do to you? There have been NO long term viable studies done on GMO canola oil, but there are reports on the internet that it has caused many kidney, liver, and neurological health issues. This would make sense since there are other reports that GMO products like corn and soy also can cause negative health effects.A 2011 review published in Environmental Sciences Europe, 19 studies of mammals fed GMO soybeans and corn were evaluated. The 90-day long trials indicate liver and kidney problems as a result of GMO foods. Kidney's were disrupted by 43.5% and liver by 30.8%.Rapeseed Oil is a monounsaturated oil, and has high levels of erucic acid. Erucic Acid is a fatty acid that is associated with heart damage, specifically Heshan's Disease, a disease that manifests itself with fibrotic lesions of the heart.In the 1970&#8242;s, food manufacturers came up with a method to genetically modify the rapeseed plant by seed splitting. This process produced a canola oil with less erucic acid, and higher amounts of oleic acid, which lead to additional concerns with canola oil, like:Blood Platelet AbnormalitiesRetards Normal Growth (Illegal in infant formulas)Free Radical DamageHigher Cancer Risks Due To The Hydrogenation ProcessIt's also important to understand that this new processed oil goes through many steps, most of which harm the nutritional value and actually change the oil's structure causing it to become hydrogenated oil.According to the Weston A. Price foundation and Fat Experts Sally Fallon and Mary Enig state:""Like all modern vegetable oils, canola oil goes through the process of refining, bleaching and degumming -all of which involve high temperatures or chemicals of questionable safety. And because canola oil is high in omega-3 fatty acids, which easily become rancid and foul-smelling when subjected to oxygen and high temperatures, it must be deodorized. The standard deodorization process removes a large portion of the omega-3 fatty acids by turning them into trans fatty acids. Although the Canadian government lists the trans content of canola at a minimal 0.2 percent, research at the University of Florida at Gainesville, found trans levels as high as 4.6 percent in commercial liquid oil. The consumer has no clue about the presence of trans fatty acids in canola oil because they are not listed on the label.""Those are the types of oils you want to avoid like the plague: Hydrogenated and Partially Hydrogenated oils!Trans fatty acids are the result of this hydrogenation process. These are hazardous by-products, and are health destroyers. You should stop cooking with these oils as well: Corn Oils, Safflower Oils, Soy Oils, and Vegetable Oil.Food manufacturers are not required by law to tell you if their products contain GMO's. It's up to us to be well informed, and read the labels. Monsanto has been incorporating genetically modified organisms in its canola oil seeds, and now we know that Monsanto has also been selling GMO seeds for the following plants:CanolaAlfalfaCornCottonSoybeansSugarbeetsHow to Choose A Good OilWhen you're buying a cooking oil, consider these things:Choose a ""Cold Pressed"" or ""Extra Virgin"" type.Should be available in glass containers.The bottle should be a dark color for olive oil, and kept in a dark place once opened.Make sure it is GMO-free.Go with Organic.What does Extra-Virgin Mean? It's simply another way of referring to ""cold pressed"", which means that the oil was made by using pressure to extract the oil from the seeds, grains, nuts, etc., and there was no heat utilized during the processing. Heat causes a degrading of the nutritional value of the oil. Extra Virgin also means that no chemical solvent was used, nor was it deodorized or altered in any way.What Oil to Use Instead? I personally use:Coconut Oil - coconut oil is best when it's cold pressed and virgin. Do NOT buy refined coconut oil. Your coconut oil should smell like you're on a beach in the Caribbean. It has a high heat threshold and contains MCFA's Medium Chain Fatty Acids that can support fat-loss and your nervous system.Olive Oil - I don't recommend Olive Oil for cooking but it has tremendous health benefits and is at the heart of the Mediterranean diet. Look for extra virgin olive oil and use it on salad's and other cold dishes.Organic Pastured Butter / Ghee - Contains ALA and CLA which can promote weight loss. Also, contains healthy short chain fatty acids and has a higher heat threshold. Stick with Organic only when buying butter.Red Palm Oil -- Red palm oil is made from the palm fruit instead of the palm kernel, and in its unrefined state, it is high in vitamin E and beta-carotene. It's also stable under high heat and great for cooking.Now that you're armed with the facts, use them to guard your health! Stay clear of Canola Oil, and all GMO foods.Sources and resources:Look for foods with the Non-GMO label.

It's real easy to eat and nice to mix into other grains like oatmeal if you need to use it up. It smells wonderful when you're cooking it. If you cook it slowly on the stove like we do, it seems to take forever to thicken up and then all of a sudden - bam - it's thick and your done. Custard is like that, too.

doc06467,food,train,"It's just a real pain to try to review ingredients, but here goes:  I wanted to make miso soup from scratch.  This involves Kombu and Bonito flakes.  The biggest and best asian supermarket in my city is a former big neighborhood grocery store, but packed with about twice the number of goods.  I actually LOVE shopping there... unless I have to find something new and in a hurry.  By some miracle, I found the Bonito flakes.  Later, I found out that Amazon has those (Nishimoto - Dried Shaved Bonito Flakes (15 Packs in 3 Bags) - 1.56 Oz) though in more quantity than I really wanted currently.  If the recipe I have is any good, I'll be back to that Amazon page.  But to make a rambling review longer, I set out to ask someone where to find Kombu.  Somewhat bizarrely, this store straddles the border between a large asian community and a large hispanic community.  Most of the staff in the asian market speaks Spanish and little English.  One stocker I knew years back gave me funny looks when I talked to him.  His English is fluent now, but he wasn't there the day I was shopping.  One other person on staff is the son of the owners and speaks fluent English and Chinese.  I finally got him to help me find the Kombu... only to find out that some other company rep stocked their japanese section for them and he had no clue if they had Kombu or where it would be if they did!

After reading the two recipes on the back, here is what we improvised: Chop up half a small cabbage, an onion, two cloves of garlic, two stalks of celery, a red bell pepper and a few small portabella mushrooms. Saute in about a Tablespoon of olive oil. Soak the noodles for a minute or so. Add the noodles to the mix. Add one small can of chopped anchovies, along with the oil from the can. My son put lots of red pepper (cayenne) in, and I thought it would be too much, but it was actually delicious in it. We had a package of portabella mushroom soup in the fridge, so I added about a third cup of that for flavor and moisture. With this package of Peacock Brown Rice Vermicelli, a little imagination we concocted a delicious hot dinner dish. The only thing I would have added if I had some would have been some seafood--such as scallops and/or shrimp. Bits of chicken would have worked nicely, too. It was quite filling and satisying.

Yacon is a close relative of the sunflower and Jerusalem artichoke, but tastes kind of like a dried apple with perhaps a hint of sweet potato.The plant itself is a tuber that is composed mostly of water and fructo-oligosaccharides, which are prebiotics that increase the amount of beneficial bacteria in the digestive tract and have also been shown to increase calcium absorption. Yacon is great for diabetics because although it tastes sweet the type of sugar can't be absorbed by humans, but since it feeds the friendly bacteria in the digestive system it boosts the immune system and helps digestion.

They're HUGE - like large eggrolls folded over and stuffed with peas and potatoes in a spicy mixture and the mint chutney condiment adds a delightful complex flavor to the samosas.  I microwaved my samosas but to get the real fried texture, it's probably better to fry them in a little oil.  I have to agree with other reviewers that their samosas rival what you'll find in a really good Indian restaurant.  I've never seen them made so good and so huge and so authentic by any other indian food maker.  You may want make a type of raita with the mint chutney condiment by adding sour cream or greek yogurt or regular yogurt to it to help cool down the spicy heat from the samosas and make the chutney creamier and less liquidy.  I also usually add loose leaf lettuce/herbs and sliced cucumbers to my raita like it's a ""cooling"" salad-raita mixture.

doc08612,food,train,"Since Amazon is lumping together the reviews for High Protein and Spelt, I will make this a dual review.These pretzels are organic with excellent ingredients:High Protein: Organic unbleached wheat flour, yellow pea flour, gluten, organic sunflower oil, salt, organic sugar, organic barley malt, yeast, and soda [presumably baking soda].Spelt: Organic spelt flour, organic sunflower oil, salt, yeast, and soda [presumably baking soda].I was tempted to purchase a pack of 12 of the High Protein here on Amazon before ever tasting any of these pretzels but, thankfully, my husband urged me to try them first, buying a package from my local grocery store. I bought both a bag of both High Protein and Spelt. The High Protein tasted burnt, but the Spelt did not. My husband likes the burnt taste of the High Protein. I didn't like it much initially, but I noticed that after eating three or more of the High Protein, I acclimated to the burnt taste and it stopped bothering me--unless I ate at the same time some Spelt pretzels. Then I really noticed the burnt flavor. Ultimately, my husband and I decided to buy a dozen packages of the Spelt, since we both like that flavor.Customers might want to know that it is not clear why only one of these types of Newman's pretzels is called ""high protein,"" because the nutritional information on the packages of the High Protein and the Spelt is very close. A serving of High Protein has 4 grams of fiber and 5 grams of protein. A serving of Spelt has 4 grams of fiber and 4 grams of protein. I also find them equally satisfying as to texture, and both are equally filling and keep me from being hungry when I don't have time to stop for a full meal, which makes them an excellent snack on the go.Finally, I calculated the actual calorie count, and it is substantially less than they list on the package, which is good news. On a kitchen scale I weighed out 30 grams of pretzels, which the package lists as a serving size. I discovered that 30 grams consists of many more than the 18 pretzels they state, and I also subtracted 12 calories from the 120 calories listed per serving for the 4 grams of fiber, or a net of 108. I learned that these pretzels are only a little over 4 calories per pretzel vs. the 6.7 calories per pretzel they would be if a 30 grams serving consisted of only 18 pretzels."

doc03232,food,valid,"Some, of course, object to the hype of ""A good source of calcium & 4 vitamins,"" but at least the company added some nutritional value.  The list of ingredients is a bit odd--some B vitamins are identified as such, some aren't.  With so much fat & sugar, this product certainly isn't health food.  It's not cinnamon buns either--but what can you expect from what is basically an iced cinnamon cookie?  At only 50g, one will survive an occasional indulgence--convenient for lunch box, aircraft carryon, etc.  The taste is pretty good, IMHO.  Lots of wheat though--gluten doesn't like me much.  It is nice to see a company (Kellog's) branching out--this isn't a cereal.  However, many of the the cookies in my package were broken.  Didn't effect the flavor, but lots of crumbs."
doc02059,food,train,"Usually, I try to avoid things with gluten and I will very rarely order something that contains wheat ingredients. I never really gain weight when I do purchase products that contain wheat but it's still something I stay away from (wheat-belly hype) -- for the most part.I wanted to make something clear that NOT every ingredient is listed on Amazon's description. There is a single NON-organic ingredient in these crackers and it is rosemary extract. I'm what you might call a ""serious"" organic buyer and if I find a non-organic ingredient on the label AFTER I buy the product then I get a little angry.However, these crackers are really good. They're big -- like sandwich bread big -- and they are addictive. Someone with little or no self control might eat an entire 7 ounce box of these in one sitting. I did, and I covered them in organic sunbutter. I'm not ashamed!I did take these off of subscribe and save because I was miffed about one of the ingredients not being organic, but I am thinking about ordering them again because I think sunbutter just tastes that much better with a crunchy, cheesy, and pumpkin seed-y companion.Be aware that the seeds will get stuck in your teeth and the crackers are very, VERY crunchy."

doc06766,food,train,"Not much to say about this pasta. The taste is great, the pasta cooks up perfectly when following the timing and instructions as shown on the box. I've been using all shapes and varieties of Barilla pasta for years and never had a single complaint. Rotini is my personal favorable pasta shape because it seems to pick up a lot of sauce from the plate and also is very easy to jab with a fork.No complaints here, and rarely will you find my kitchen pantry without at least a couple boxes of this stuff waiting to be used shortly."

It's labeled medium-hot but I found it to be a little spicier than expected; not to worry though,I toned it down by adding a tsp of lite sour cream - yum! I think you'll enjoy this product. The flavor is so good that you really don't miss the salt."
doc01896,food,train,"This coffee was very good at breakfast, it is low acid and brewed up in our Hamilton Beach drip machine nicely. I gave it a 4 star instead of 5 because it is a very fine grind, probably closer to an espresso grind than a drip but the description doesn't say that. It did work in the drip machine. I found that the best way to get a not to strong cup of coffee was to measure one teaspoon of coffee grounds less per cup then I normally would. Once I did that it made a very fine pot of coffee."

Don't delude yourself into thinking that these count as a serving of fruit, or in any way provide positive nutritional value beyond the added vitamin C. They are tasty though. I enjoy their strong fruity flavor and their quality of being gummy but not too sticky.I think this assortment should contain more of the ""mixed berry"" flavor and fewer of the other two flavors (cherry and strawberry). When there's a case of these fruit snacks available for snacking on at my workplace, the mixed berry always disappears long before the other flavors."

doc01843,food,train,"This is formula designed to not trigger cow milk allergies in babies.  I also used the infant formula version of thisEnfamil Prosobee Soy Infant Formula Powder with Iron, 22 Ounce (Pack of 4) (Packaging May Vary)to supplement occasionally starting when baby was 6 months old.  My baby doesn't have an allergy as far as I know.  I think that you are supposed to start with a regular lower priced formula, and then if baby is colicy or fussy, try different allergy free formulas, like this one.  Cow milk allergy can cause gas, which makes a baby cry, and so in case that's the issue, work through other formulas.Now for this formula.  The number one ingredient in this is ""corn syrup solids"", and the label helpfully informs me that corn syrup solids is 57% of the weight of this powder.  Wow!  That's a lot of sugar.  And most formulas have about half sugar or corn syrup, so there you go:  that's formula.This is for 9 to 18 month old toddlers.  From reading, I know that babies can't process protein like an adult, so maybe that's why the corn syrup.  This Toddler Transitions formula does have fats and vitamins, which is good because babies need that.  My baby had the infant version of this soy based formula very occassionally starting at 6 months usually mixed in with baby cereal, and since 9 1/2 months eats about 3 - 6 oz of this formula per day to supplement breast milk and mushy food.  He eats it fine, and doesn't seem to have a problem with taste or anything.The odd thing about this formula versus other formulas is that it smells ever so slightly like rotten eggs when you mix it.  It tastes normal, though.  I lick the spoon after I mix baby cereal with this.  I think the bad smell is just from something related to formula being specially formulated to not cause allergies."

What one first experiences is a rich chocolate like aroma that rises as it is being brewed. Thats tempting enough. When first sipped, a sweet yet not to sweet ( the D.H. Chocolate Glazed Donut is the strongest and sweetest) flavor with no bitter after taste prevalent in a lot of darker roasted Kcups I have sampled.

doc01025,food,valid,"In this cereal, there are muligrain flakes, pecans, and the raisins and dates add sweetness naturally.  I like sweet cereals but don't like the sugar that comes with them.  There is still sugar added (brown and regular both), but there is less due to the dried fruits in the cereal.  Good taste, good texture and visually appealing -- what a great combination.It's very filling and often a bowl of this and a piece of fresh fruit are my choices for lunch during the week."
doc02051,food,valid,"I used to eat a honey called ""spun honey"" back in the 70's and it's the closest thing I can relate to this delicious, spreadable honey.  I am a new, frequent buyer of this honey (my 3rd order) and I find it is delicious and soothing right off the spoon during allergy season where post-nasal drip is so prevalent.  I've always loved honey on the comb and know that raw honey (not the stuff you buy in your regular supermarket that is processed and could even contain corn syrup - yikes) is healing and has many therapeutic properties to it.  In Ayurveda medicine, raw honey is considered to have many healing properties.This honey is thick and when brought to room temperature, can be easily spread on a cracker, bagel, etc.  It can be softened by warming it but I have not found the need.Delicious, hearty raw honey with all the essential ingredients (pollens, pieces of the comb or even bee wings - all being nondiscernible) is the way to go.  A little pricier ... yes ... but this is a great product and the difference is in the taste and the texture.Love it!"

It's also very good with turmeric and served with Indian dishes like curry.  It's delicious and very healthy.  Since it's already cooked, to perfect tenderness, the toil of prep is eliminated, which is very convenient.  The flavor is superior to frozen.

doc02753,food,train,"Frontier is the producer of the fancy small glass spice containers called Simply Organic but the same organic is sold under Frontier brand in bigger quantities in silver bags. Frontier is a good brand and this is organic. Check prices due to variations in market. Oregano has a strong taste so I consume just small amount of it every night to get the benefits. Oregano gives me omega-3, 8% vitamin K and many anti-oxidants and disease preventing properties. One teaspoon contains not only six micrograms of bone-building vitamin K but also the same amount of antioxidants as three cups of spinach. Fresh has strong smell and taste anything over couple of months old will lose it sharpness and taste as well as nutrients. I never freeze and unfreeze spices since moisture will ruin its taste and form so purchasing the right quantity is as important as the brand regardless organic or conventional.Carvacrol, a plant compound in the herb oregano, is effective against highly infectious Norovirus, a common cause of food-borne disease and a particular problem in nursing homes, hospitals, cruise ships and schools. Although unpleasant, the infection usually passes in a few days but it can pose a dangerous threat to some people with underlying medical problems. Experiments showed that carvacrol acts directly on the capsid, the tough shell of proteins surrounding the virus that encloses its genetic material. Oregano's chemical strips the virus of its `armor', a tough outer protein coat, making it more vulnerable and easier to destroy.Oregano and Mustard seeds are one of a handful number of foods recommended by CDC during heavy flu season. Black, white and brown varieties, a cruciferous vegetable, in the same family as cabbage, brussels, sprouts and broccoli that when chewed up and eaten, the vegetables release substances called isothiocyanates, beneficial for lungs. High in selenium with anti-inflammatory properties, beneficial in treating medical conditions such as asthma and rheumatoid arthritis.FRESHNESS: Fresh means nutritious and delicious. I consume lots of seeds, nuts, beans, grains, vegetables, etc. and freshness is a priority regardless of the brand so I always purchase my food ingredients in small quantities from reputable sellers with high turnover. When fresh, food is nutritious and that goes for any food in any form, from frozen to canned. Fresh food is nutritious as well as delicious since nutrients give food its delicious taste. When old or rancid, nutrients are gone and any food item becomes an empty calories with no taste and absolutely worthless regardless of the brand or price, organic or conventional."

I got it as a present for her since the Wally World Brand is no longer available.  We have looked everywhere, but not found one that tastes as good (her words) as this one. Consistency is that of peanut butter, but no allergic reactions. If you are looking for a good tasting substitute for peanut butter, try this one.I like Skippy All Natural Chunky and this is not what I want/like,but...

doc06533,food,valid,"Impressed, K-Saver appears to be of good quality and so far works good. Instructions hard to read, very small print and poor print quality. I believe K-Saver will last longer then the leading plastic competitor and gives a much better seal. Works a lot better then the Keurig My K-Cup Reusable Coffee Filter, which leaks and makes a mess with every use.K-Saver has not leaked so for. If K-saver doesn't snap right on, just run your fingernail around the edge where the K-Saver meets the rim and apply a little pressure to the K-Saver. K-Cups are not uniformly manufactured among vendors and the filters are not always mounted correctly.I have also found that tearing the seal off doesn't always leave a good, clean surface, and can be a lot of work. Using a very sharpe-thin blade, always cut away from your body, like a hobby knife, cut counterclockwise (CCW) with blade laying almost flat on the rim of the K-Cup. This produces a cleaner surface and doesn't interfere with the filter if it is not mounted correctly.Tip: Use a small foam brush, our Walmart has a 1"" chiseled brush with a wooden handle for 50 cents, for cleaning the K-Cup. Works great, easy to clean.Tip: When inserting used K-Cups into the brewer, the easest way to line up the bottom hole with the pin is as follows. Place the K-Cup with the bottom hole in the direction of the white arrow, then tip the K-Cup slightly foward and rotate slowly left or right and the K-Cup will fall right onto the pin.Strange sightings, little black specks on counter top and under dish rack. Bugs, foreign matter from the ceiling fan, alien foo-foo dust? No, its coffee grounds that get trapped under the metal strip spring covering the center hole. If the grounds don't get completely rinsed out, they fall out after they dry out, leaving a trail. Now you know.Happy brewing and save a little green in the process."

I say ALMOST because desperation produces creative approaches to eating even the most frozen pint.I love this stuff, and I would eat any of the flavors.

They are so fresh and so satisfying. I just ordered the chocolate ones for next time.  I plan never to be without them.  I want them on the tea table always.  Trust me.  Read the label - they are great.So, I am adding to the review!  The two friends who were here when the cookies arrived,  I had shared some of the cookies with them  raved about the cookies, wanted to know where I got them and are ordering them.  One had a house full of guests and I had given her 2 sacks, knowing she was having Pumpkin Festival guests - she said they all want these cookies.  I think they are all natural products so that helps.  I have the chocolate ones in my shopping cart but am holding off as I am eating too many,  I ate - alone - one sack on the weekend.  I dare not open more this week.  You have to try these.  I am sure I did not dream about them.  They are not too sweet.  I think you can read the ingredients.  Great for people with braces.  Sigh!OKAY, OKAY, OKAY - I AM BACK TO ADD ON . . . I just bought the dark Chocolate - I don't even like dark Chocolate so I chose that as friends will like them for dessert and I won't be tempted (fat chance) to eat them.  I know I will.

doc03170,food,train,"Jones Soda has hit a home run with GABA Fuji Apple: it's a light, clean tasting, slightly sweet and refreshing drink. The balance between the tea and the apple juice is spot on. As a refreshing drink that isn't a soda, I think you'd be hard pressed to find a better option in this class. However, I don't think this is really a true 'Health Drink'. For Gaba to really be effective you need a whopping 2Grams (the drink has 150mg). Also the 2nd ingredient in this pupppy is sugar.If you really want GABBA without the sugar and in more concentrated amounts you're best bet is to drink Gaba tea directly. So with the caveat that it isn't really a health drink, I recommend it as a light and refreshing drink that isn't a carbonated soda."
doc06880,food,valid,While my favorite relaxing tea is calledCelestial Seasonings Sleepytimethis tea is a close second. This is made with just chamomile flowers for maximum effect.

doc01236,food,train,"I usually only buy honey from local sources because of the scandal of high fructose corn syrup being mixed in with almost all honeys you find commercially.  I also like that local honey is unpasteurized, which preserves the enzymes and anti-bacterial quality of the honey. We use a lot of honey in baking and on our food, so having a quality product is important to us.I tried this honey just to see if it was a good as the description makes it sound.  I'm really impressed!  I love that it's organic and non-GMO, and of course the fair trade aspect means the people who tend the bees are actually getting paid for the honey. The one downside is that it's been pasteurized.  But the flavor of this honey is the best part. It has a dark, rich taste that reminds me of molasses or sorghum.  It was lovely on toast, much different than clover or apple blossom honey.I wouldn't buy this product for baking because it's rather expensive ($8+ per 16 oz) but as a condiment at the table, I think we've found a new favorite."

The thing that surprised me is that it appears to be mostly a cocoa product, by the color, anyway. Looking at it, I see cocoa, but the taste does say cinnamon. Kind of a conflicted product, to me.The taste is not too sweet, but the crunchiness seems a bit low, almost like it is going stale. I don't think I got a stale bag, but it doesn't crunch as much as I'd like in a granola. Overall, I'm not real impressed. It's ok, but not significantly different than other granola options."

This tea has a nice ""yummy"", semi-rich taste (with 2% milk & sugar) & is a good alternative to the other green/fruit/chai teas that I drink.

I am literally paying 4x more for organic sugar and I normally wouldn't complain, but I use sugar everyday!I bought 2x of these to test them out for taste / quality and I do notice a difference in quality. Once its in my tea, it pretty much tastes almost the same as regular sugar.The packet itself is fairly decent in size for a 1 pound bag. People, please don't expect a huge packet of sugar.I drink my own tea at home almost everyday and I use cane sugar. So far, I started on my first packet last night and today im already 90% done with the one pound packet.

I froze them for four hours, let thaw for about half an hour, and then blended them in my food processor (a blender works) for a short time. Amazing results! The ice cream has a great coffee flavor without any kind of aftertaste. You would have thought that I added real coffee. I am so pleased that I am making two more batches of this stuff. This sweetener also works well in coffee and protein shakes."

So perfect.It does have a strong maple flavor - almost smoky. Very deep. Very pronounced. If you are looking for a light, sweet syrup, this isn't it. But for us, we have gotten used to the lovely deep flavor of maple, and we don't like Grade A syrups - too sweet without flavor. Just to compare for those used to purchasing the Costco maple syrup - this is darker and has a more pronounced flavor. More flavorful also than the Trader Joes syrups. And if you are used to the generic pancakes syrups - this is nothing like those - this is a wonderful maple syrup flavor that doesn't give that weird sugar rush/taste.Makes great cookies, sweet potatoes, pumpkin bread - we use it in place of refined sugars in many recipes to sweeten them. We enjoy the flavor it gives recipes.Hope this helps - it is difficult to buy this kind of stuff online, and I know I rely on others' experience when it comes to expensive food products.

Both my son (who is now over 2 years old) and my daughter (now almost one) have used a wide variety of foods from Earth's Best. I am a huge proponent of feeding children primarily organic and/or locally grown foods to promote proper nutrition and growth. But I do not feel that all organic brands are equal.

doc00224,food,train,"I have been living in Shanghai for over four years now, so I have a pretty good idea of what good tea tastes like. And this is not even close to good tasting tea. I drink only the best quality Long Jing Green Tea and I drink about 1.5 liters per day. But I admit that my Chinese green tea is much more expensive than this tea..I like my tea cold and with a little sugar. I brew my own tea in China at 180 degrees F, not hotter and not cooler. I put the tea in the microwave oven in a glass container with plastic wrap over the top of the pitcher. The plastic wrap helps maintain the heat for longer after the peak temperature has been reached. I let it brew for probably an hour until it cools down to a slightly warm temperature. I pour in one-third a cup of sugar and mix it while the tea is warm. I brew the tea leaves two times with half of the 1.5 liter bottle of water each time. Then I mix the tea together and refrigerate it for at least 24 hours, preferably 48 hours. I have found the refrigeration cycle makes the tea mellower and not bitter. Even my 56 year old Chinese fianc&eacute;e says my tea brewing method tastes better than she has ever tasted in her life. I know that refrigeration is contrary to what a lot of people think is best. But I learned this technique when I was a teenager working in a Baptist Encampment in Texas during the summer. A cook taught me that putting the huge vat of tea into a cooler for a day makes tea more mellow tasting and less bitter. And I always got great compliments way back then from the hundreds of people who drank my tea. Of course, this was just ordinary tea, not green tea. But it works the same way with green tea.The tea leaves in this tea do not look the same as what I buy in China, and the taste is quite different -- definitely bitterer. The Numi Tea sold here on Amazon is whole leaf and looks a lot better than these tea leaves. These tea leaves are a mix of whole leaf and confetti chopped up leaves. The taste is about the same as Numi Tea, but I will purchase the Numi brand going forward because it is 100% whole leaf and not dusty.I have read that the best leaves are the newly formed leaves picked from of the top of the tea tree. I have visited tea tree farms in China. Tea trees will grow into a real tree unless they are pruned to remain like a waist high tree shrub. I suspect this particular brand of tea leaves may have come from the older more mature lower branches of the tea tree. But I have no way of knowing if that is true or not. I just know it doesn't taste nearly as good as the tea leaves I purchase in China. And to be fair, the price I pay in China is considerably more than this price on Amazon."

doc02314,food,valid,This is an excellent product and tastes wonderful in baked goods. The rich vanilla flavor enhances anything that the ground beans are added to.
doc07057,food,train,"We are gluten, casein, and soy free and it's very difficult to find anything that doesn't have soy in it that doesn't taste and feel like cracker crumb crust.  This is very good, and very reasonable.  The family loved it, specially my 7yr. old grandson with autism, who hates almost everything (just like mikey).  Will definitely buy it again."
doc01191,food,train,"I used to love Twizzler's licorice. Then I tried this soft liquorice from Australia. Wow, what a difference. The flavor is amazingly zestful. The liquorice is soft and chewy (unlike Twizzler's, which sometimes you have to pull apart to eat). Mango is also a great idea for a flavor - sweet, but different from the usual flavors. Looking back, I can hardly believe how I lived without these in my life. I know these things have sugar and might not be great for my health, but what the heck - it's worth the price!"
doc04759,food,valid,"I gave these to my daughter to use to share with friends. I suggested she use them if her friend had a team competition one day or perhaps a fellow band member needing encouragement. They do things like that at her school - require all team members to provide a little encouragement to others. They served their purpose. As far as a ""great"" reward, the candy is small and as some have mentioned, you need a permanent marker or ball point pen for writing a ""very short"" message. But, they are only supposed to be for a 'small' surprise or thought anyway, so I think they serve their purpose."
doc08313,food,train,I bought the large bag to be able to share with friends.  I was happy with the quality and freshness on arrival.  Item arrived in a vacuumed sealed airtight plastic bag with a rope handle.  I would definitely buy again.
doc05906,food,train,"I bought this expecting to be able to enjoy the savory flavor of man's closest living genetic relative, the chimpanzee.  When I tasted this chocolate bar, all I could taste is dark chocolate.  Now, had this been marketed as just a dark chocolate bar, then I would have given it a four or five star rating, as JUST chocolate it's fine and quite tasty.  But look at the label, there is quite clearly a chipmanzee on the label.  Where is the chimp flavor?  Had I wanted just chocolate flavor I would have bought such.  Please stop such false advertising and put at least extract from the flesh of a chimpanzee into this chocolate bar."
doc02710,food,train,"This is a delicious tangy/sweet pickle, unavailable in our local stores, and we enjoy it with pork sausages, roast beef, hamburgers and hotdogs. My personal complaint is that I wish it were ground up for easy spreading,  so every bottle we receive, I put the contents through the blender, and then back into the original bottle. My husband, who is 86, and has had dental problems, find the pieces of pickle to large to eat comfortably."

doc04918,food,train,I'm an olympic weightlifter and I eat mostly paleo.  I also have a son who has celiac.  These bars are AWESOME.  A perfect snack.  I tuck them in my gym back to eat after practice; my son brings them to school.  They have kind of a sweet-and-sour thing going with the buffalo and dried cranberry.  I think it's a delicious combination.  I'm buying my second case today.
doc00700,food,train,I like it but it is not my absolute favorite freeze dried fruit. It has a flavor that I can only take in limited amounts.
doc03921,food,valid,"As you can see I purchased the Habanero BBQ flavor, and it tastes exactly like  a finer BBQ potato chip brand. The difference is I like BBQ potato chips because the mixture is just right. For me, it takes away the flavor of the almond, while Wasabi and Soy just seems to be the best tasting for an almond. Wasabi and Soy is still #1 in my book, and is the best tasting Blue Diamond Bold."
doc02972,food,valid,"I like this tea, and the amount of boxes that come in this tea you HAVE to love it.  I initially thought 6 boxes seems excessive (as I bought it from amazon to try it), but I actually have come to enjoy this tea quite a bit.  I don't notice any &#34;blues away&#34;, but I'm also not depressed or anything, I just like the taste"
doc03514,food,train,"I have always liked jasmine green tea, but rarely bought it because of the price.  I found this tea at a local store and figured it couldn't hurt to give it a try.  I mean, 100 tea bags for a price I'd normally pay for 20 or 25?  Even if I didn't like it, I figured I wouldn't be out much money.  And it's organic, to boot!I ended up loving this jasmine green tea, though.  Unlike some of the other reviewers, I drink it fairly strong -- I steep for probably at least 5-10 minutes (but then, the hot water at my office is NOT boiling and perhaps it takes longer to steep for that reason?).  I only use each bag once.  I have been drinking at least 4 cups a day lately.  If you are drinking green tea for the health benefits, this is certainly an economical choice.I love the jasmine aroma that comes from the cup.  I find the jasmine flavor to be light and not at all overpowering.  I also reach for this tea right after lunch, especially if I've had something that smells kind of strong (e.g. garlic or raw onions).  I figure it's better for me than a mint, and I think the compounds in the tea neutralize some odors.  Plus, I'm not coating my teeth with sugar that way (I don't sweeten it, although you certainly could).To address some concerns: yes, this is a Chinese import.  But China is the world's largest grower of tea.  Many teas are likely grown in China and may not even be labeled as such.  (Plus, I've been drinking this for awhile and I'm doing fine!)  The bags are brown because they're not bleached, which is better for the environment.  The wrappings around the individual tea bags are paper, so they could be recycled if you wanted.  And even though the wrappers are paper, and not airtight, you can open the box and leave it for months, and the tea is still good (I've done this)."
doc04152,food,valid,"As far as Chia seeds go, you can hop between brands here on amazon and they all taste the same. Sure there are people who complain about a bag bag or what not, but I am sure those are few and far between. 3 pounds for under $25 which if you take a serving almost everyday will last your almost 3 months (~70 servings). I am assuming if you are looking a Chia seeds you already know the health benefits. Healthy fats, No net-cars (all fiber), and a good source of protein, potassium, calcium and iron. Enough said there. But do they taste good? If you just eat a spoonful of them the answer is no. Its like chewing on just about any other grain in the raw. There are several ways to enjoy them, meaning they actually enhance a dish. I personally use them in yogurt. I feel it adds a texture to yogurt not identical but similar to granola. People also frequently add them to oatmeal, salads, soups and protein shakes to name a few. You will notice a trend in that they work well in mixtures.Only complaints I have is the pre-cut tear-off on the bag is useless, but I own a pair a scissors so the problem lasted about 2 seconds. The bag does come with a Ziploc like top that has worked just fine for me.Overall five stars. If you are looking for Chia Seeds, look no further."

doc03678,food,train,"This is an update to my original review below which stands as written. There is no denying they taste good BUT I want to add a thought based on material I've read:  Besides being manufactured in Mexico, the forth ingredient listed is Titanium Dioxide.  Based on the information I've read, I've decided this will be the last bag I order.  Personally I feel this ingredient is not something I want to put into my body on a daily basis so these are gone. I don't preach so I'll just suggest that anyone who cares about what they consume do your own research.  Just Bing the ingredient and decide for yourself.Original Review:These are really good hard peppermint candies.  They have a very pleasant pronounced peppermint flavor that refresh my mouth and satisfy my urge for something sweet. Candies are individually wrapped.  Wrappers are twisted at each end...not hot sealed.  I had been trying to find hard peppermint candies similar to those they leave out at the deli at one of our local casinos.  Had tried Brach's but they were too sugary with not enough peppermint flavor.  These are very similar to the ones at the casino.The listed ingredients are:  Corn Syrup, Sugar, Water, Titanium Dioxide (Color), Peppermint Oil, Red 40, Red 3, Yellow 6, Blue 1.According to the package each candy is 20 calories.  A serving is considered 3 candies with about 212 servings per bag. That means there are well over 600 mints per bag.  There are a LOT of candies here.  After filling several candy dishes around the house I thought I could store the rest of them in a large glass wide mouth gallon jar.  Stuffed it to the brim and still had enough to almost fill another half gallon jar.The only reason I gave this item 4 stars is because it isn't made in the U.S and contains artificial coloring. It is a product of Mexico distributed by Sam's West, Inc, Bentonville, AR.Until I can find good affordable hard peppermint candies made in the U.S. with all natural ingredients and no dyes I'll continue to purchase these."
doc02244,food,valid,I have gone through every different type of organic decaf tea that I can get my hands on. Most of them have been disappointing because of weak taste. TAZO's Organic Red Herbal Infusion Caffeine Free tea is hearty with full flavor and the individual bags seem top quality. I have stock-piled it and plan to use it as my main tea.

doc05520,food,train,"We made our first slushies the day after Christmas.  Both Slushy Magic cups leaked all over from around the lid.  I'm not saying a few drops, enough that it was running down the cup and into the sink.  The drink did turn into a slushy consistency despite losing a lot from it leaking.  I took the cubes out of the cup and after washing them I noticed stuff floating in many of them and slime floating in others.  The stuff looked like a dead spider or maybe hair.  I don't know what it is but it's gross for sure and e-mailed the company to get replacement cubes.  If they come back with junk floating in them, I will want my money back."
doc06343,food,valid,"I had never tried this product before nor heard of it until I came across a vegan recipe I wanted to make.  A small amount adds a lot of flavor.  The first time my husband and I tasted it, we were impressed.  It is better than soy sauce.  Has an all natural mild taste loaded with flavor, but not too salty.  Would be excellent on vegetables, soup or  brown rice.  Liquid Aminos also contains 16 essential and non-essential amino acids.  I had a hard time finding this product in a regular grocery store.  I was delighted Amazon carried it.  I will never go back to soy sauce."

doc07963,food,valid,"This is a very good quality chili powder. Nice complex flavor, no excessively bitter. The price is good for the quality of the product. The only reason I didn't give it 5 stars is that it isn't quite as smokey as other brands."
doc06205,food,train,"This salt has a great flavor.  And, a little goes a long way.  I was very pleased with my order from DAS Salt/DAS Foods - fast shipping, great product, pleasant thank you note and samples included with my order.  Although it's not inexpensive, an order of gourmet salts is well worth it from this company.  I will be trying other varieties soon."

doc00901,food,train,"This mac & cheese cup was good, but not destined to become a favorite.I appreciate that the pasta is brown rice pasta, so it's whole grain.  (Whole grain gluten-free products can be somewhat elusive.)  And, although ""instant"" meals are rarely the HEALTHIEST option, it's nice to have some reasonably healthy ones around for when you need to grab something in a hurry.  This works nicely for that purpose.  It boiled over in my microwave during the last 20 seconds or so, so it made a big mess.  And, frankly, it didn't taste particularly cheesy to me.  But it WAS nice and creamy, and it tasted good enough.  Again - plenty sufficient, just not a FAVORITE.This would not be sufficiently caloric to provide a whole meal for me, as an adult, but would work well as a snack (or with supplementation), and might work well as-is for a young child."
doc04343,food,train,"These are very good. I would prefer the dark chocolate coating in a darker, less sweetened chocolate, but that is just because I like the flavor of very dark chocolate (up to 86% cacao)."

doc01966,food,train,When I got this product I was surprised at how little I got. I have ordered other kefir grains and got about a 1/4 a cup. This was about the size of a thimble. It didn't work for me and turned to mush after just several days. I followed the directions exactly. I was sent a second batch. Just the same amount. So far after about a week it is making kefir but the grains are not growing very fast as others have in the past. I am using organic whole milk just as it says. Think I will try a different company next time. I don't think these will last too long.

doc02096,food,valid,"Having never purchased Goji Berries before, I am a little unsure as to the quality of these. I thought they would be a bit chewier, more like raisins. These are pretty dried out and crunchy. I do like the tart sweet taste. I don't know how anyone makes tea out of these as they only get plump after steeping but don't seem to infuse with the water. I will be looking at other brands for comparison but as of this purchase, I find them a bit disappointing and that being said have just ordered Navitas brand for comparison...time will tell."
doc02604,food,train,"I can hardly believe how tasty this stuff is. I was first introduced to stevia sweetener in the Sobe Lifewater drinks. I knew that I had to find some for at-home use. I now use it regularly in my breakfast tea, smoothies, etc. Since they're in the packets, I haven't tried Truvia in baking, but I can say that it is great in drinks. Also, I don't experience any digestive problems or gross aftertaste that people often get with other types of sugar substitutes like aspartame or sucralose.Purchasing it on Amazon is an amazing deal. With this quantity I won't be running out of it anytime soon, but I'll definitely be back for more."

doc03543,food,train,"With almost no freezer space, I can't keep an endless supply of chicken broth on hand as much as I'd like to. Also, with the price of chicken, making one's own stock is an expensive proposition.These days, I make broth for important dishes and use the Organic Broth for most everything else.Cook's Illustrated rated this broth the best next to homemade from about 8 other competitors.I like the fact that it's organic, low in sodium and free range, as well. It's also nice to have on hand. With subscribe and save, it's a lot less than the $3.00 average it costs here in the local markets.The broth has a clean flavor profile and while I wouldn't use it for a chicken soup by itself, I do use it with stronger flavored soups, such as tomato. It doesn't taste overly fake to me.I also like the shelf stable packaging and that an open container is good for 3 or 4 days in the fridge."
doc06253,food,train,"I received a ""prototype"" gift basket, along with other Vine reviewers so I'm a bit perplexed as to what people are supposed to get when they buy this basket. The basket basically consists of completely random gifts, probably around $25 worth, in a $70 basket. There was no bow and pretty much all of the items (Kenzi) were shrinkwrapped in pretty generic-looking white boxes. The basket was quite nice, though.The basket contains your standard snack assortment - popcorn, pretzels, cookies, various nuts, cheese, crackers - nothing out of the ordinary. There are 27 items in the basket, according to the manufacturer. The only two things that really stood out were the inclusion of Jelly Bellys (always welcome) and the mustard, which was downright delicious. In fact, the mustard was my favorite part of the gift basket. Yes, the mustard. In fact, it led to a pretty awkard family argument over Christmas while tasting everything in the basket. The mustard was a hit.Overall I'm pretty indifferent about the basket. I wouldn't buy this for anyone because basically it says that you really don't care about the recipient but felt obligated to buy them something to share. And what's strange is that there are a number of reviews indicating that they've received ""prototypes"" over the last few months, so I really can't guarantee that you'd get the same things that were included in the basket I got to evaluate.If it wasn't for the uncertainty and the relative blandness of the Kenzi food (taste and packaging), this would be worth a purchase if it were on sale (full price? not so sure.) But if the best thing in this basket was a jar of mustard, well, it's time to take a pass."
