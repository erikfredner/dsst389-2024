## Deadline

This project is due by the start of class on Wednesday, April 23.

## Teaching with data

Your final assignment is to teach your classmates something using data. This project is open-ended by design.

You should choose a topic that you already know something about and are interested in so that you can make a good argument.

### Data

You may choose or create any dataset with my approval. You may also use datasets we have used in previous classes if they happen to be appropriate for your topic.

#### Choosing

If you plan to look for a dataset, considering searching in the following places:

- [Google Dataset Search](https://datasetsearch.research.google.com)
  - A search engine for datasets.
- [Data.gov](https://data.gov)
  - The US Government's repository for public data.
- [United Nations data](http://data.un.org)
  - The UN's repository for public data.
- [Data is Plural](https://www.data-is-plural.com)
  - A newsletter highlighting interesting datasets.
- [Our World in Data](https://ourworldindata.org/data)
  - A repository of public data on global issues.
- [Harvard Dataverse](https://dataverse.harvard.edu)
  - A research data repository.
- [Awesome Public Datasets](https://github.com/awesomedata/awesome-public-datasets)
  - A GitHub repository of curated public datasets.
  
:::{.callout-warning}
As a general rule, I would advise against using [Kaggle Datasets](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets). Anyone can upload data to Kaggle, and uploaders do not always document their datasets. Moreover, many Kaggle datasets partially duplicate some of the sources above. That said, **if** the data you are interested in is only available on Kaggle, you may use it if you receive my approval.
:::

#### Creating

If you want to create a dataset of your own (e.g., collect text documents for analysis), you may do so, but you need to document your process.

## Work products

Final projects will consist of the following components:

1. Dataset description (survey response)
2. Write-up (`.qmd` + PDF)
3. Presentation (`.qmd` + slides)

I will review your proposed datasets via the survey response. If you do *not* get a response from me by April 16, your dataset is approved.

### Dataset description

Follow the instructions on [the form](https://forms.gle/xuNbKDs5vrsFaZn49).

:::{.callout-tip}
You will have to log in to Google with your `@richmond.edu` email to complete the form.
:::

### Write-up

Your final project document will be similar to those of your previous three group projects, but this one will be your own work. It must include:

- An argumentative frame for the analysis ("So what? Who cares?")
- An analysis consisting of at least two outputs (graphs, tables, calculated values)
- At most 500 words of prose explaining your rationale, interpreting your results, and stating your argument

### Presentation

Unlike the group projects, the final project also involves a presentation. On the final day of class, everyone will present their project. Here are the requirements for the presentation:

- No more than 4 minutes long
- Must describe your dataset
- Must include at least one of your outputs from the write-up

## Example project: Distinctive topics in children's stories

How have the topics adults discuss with children changed over time? This project compares English-language children's stories from the nineteenth century to those of the twentieth century to see which topics appear in both groups, and which differ across time. I created a corpus of children's stories using anthologies from Project Gutenberg, and analyzed the distribution of topics by year of publication. Nineteenth-century children's stories feature both more violence and more explicit moralizing than twentieth century stories. In certain ways, nineteenth-century children were more "grown-up" than twentieth-century children.

### Why is this be a good example?

- Clear motivation for the question
- Good fit between topic and data
- Good fit between method (topic modeling) and question
- Interesting result supported by evidence

## External resources

As the purpose of this group project is to imitate data science work that one might do outside of school, it is an **open-resource** project. This means that you may use books, websites, and, yes, generative artificial intelligence (GenAI) tools in order to complete this work.

All external resources, including GenAI, **must be cited** in your final document. I recommend using [The Chicago Manual of Style](https://richmond.primo.exlibrisgroup.com/permalink/01URICH_INST/191gg5k/alma9928619711206241).

Your use of all external resources, including GenAI, is constrained by the rules set out in the syllabus, which include the following:

### Prohibited Uses of GenAI

- Submitting model output, in part or in whole, as if it were your original work. This includes code *or* writing.
- Uploading any data used in this course (e.g., `.csv` files) directly to multimodal GenAI tools like ChatGPT.
- Using models for assistance *without* citing your interaction with the model.
- Using models to generate outputs that you cannot verify, explain, or understand.^[However, if a model does produce an output that you cannot verify, explain, or understand, you may use the model to improve your understanding of that output.]

### Permitted Uses of GenAI

I ask you to do these things in this order when you can't figure something out:

1. Review the course notes and slides, if relevant.
2. Talk to your classmates.
3. Search for credible information online (e.g., StackOverflow).
4. Chat with the [Custom GPT](https://chatgpt.com/g/g-6783c8a8603c8191862f677689207682-dsst389-gpt) for this class.
5. If you use information from the Custom GPT, **cite** your interactions with it.

[This page](https://help.openai.com/en/articles/7925741-chatgpt-shared-links-faq) explains how to share a link to a ChatGPT interaction.

### Things to consider when using GenAI

#### Style

The [Custom GPT](https://chatgpt.com/g/g-6783c8a8603c8191862f677689207682-dsst389-gpt) for this course is designed to help you with programming problems while following the conventions of this class. However, **you** are ultimately responsible for ensuring that your code follows the class style requirements:

- Use the base R pipe (`|>`), not the `magrittr` pipe (`|>`)
- Use `<-` to assign outputs to objects. *Do not* use `=`.
- Use `tidyverse` functions instead of base R whenever possible.
  - e.g., `as_factor()` is `tidyverse`; `as.factor()` is `{base}`.
- Style your code in accordance with the [`tidyverse` style guide](https://style.tidyverse.org/).
- Code without comments and/or documentation is incomplete.

#### Accuracy

LLMs get things wrong. That can happen because the model makes a mistake, or the person prompting the model makes a mistake. Either way, the accuracy of your code is your responsibility.

## Contribution to learning goals

This project directly addresses the following learning goals for this course:

- Collect, manipulate, tidy, visualize, and explore data using basic and advanced techniques.
- Understand key aspects of the [R programming language](https://www.r-project.org) and the [`tidyverse`](https://www.tidyverse.org).
- Use the [RStudio](https://posit.co/products/open-source/rstudio/) integrated development environment.
- Use [Quarto](https://quarto.org/) to create high-quality research documents and websites.
- Use programming language documentation, cookbooks, and large language models to solve programming problems.
